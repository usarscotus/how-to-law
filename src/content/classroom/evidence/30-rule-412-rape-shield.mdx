Rule 412 generally excludes evidence of a victim's other sexual behavior or sexual predisposition in sexual misconduct cases. The rule aims to avoid unfair prejudice, harassment, and confusion that can derail trials. Civil cases allow admission only if the probative value substantially outweighs the danger of harm to any victim and of unfair prejudice to any party.

Criminal defendants may admit specific evidence under narrow exceptions: proof of an alternate source of physical evidence such as semen, evidence of prior sexual behavior with the defendant to show consent, or evidence whose exclusion would violate the Constitution, often under the Confrontation Clause. Courts scrutinize proffers closely to ensure they meet the articulated exception.

Consider a sexual assault prosecution where the defense seeks to introduce text messages showing the complainant flirting with another person the night before the incident. The defense argues the messages suggest an alternate source of bruising and demonstrate motive to fabricate; the prosecution insists the communications are irrelevant and prejudicial.

Parties invoking an exception must file a sealed motion describing the evidence, provide at least 14 days' notice, and obtain an in camera hearing before the court rules. Judges may craft limiting instructions or redact portions of evidence to protect privacy while preserving confrontation rights.
