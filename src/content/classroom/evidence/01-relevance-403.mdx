## Logical relevance

Rule 401 defines relevant evidence as any proof that has a tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. Logical
relevance is a low bar, and most disputes focus on whether the fact is material or whether the inference chain is too attenuated.
Courts consider the factual context, the proponent's theory of the case, and alternative explanations for the evidence.

- **Materiality** asks whether the fact matters under the substantive law.
- **Probativeness** asks whether the evidence shifts the probability, even slightly.

  Map the reasoning step-by-step. If too many speculative leaps are needed, expect a relevance objection.

## Legal relevance and Rule 403

Even relevant evidence may be excluded when its probative value is substantially outweighed by dangers such as unfair prejudice,
confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence. Courts weigh:

1. The strength of the connection between the evidence and the fact of consequence.
2. The availability of alternative evidence that is less prejudicial.
3. The effectiveness of limiting instructions or redactions to reduce risk.
4. The potential to inflame jurors or distract from core disputes.

### Case spotlight: *Old Chief*

In *Old Chief*, the Supreme Court held that when the only contested issue is whether a defendant has a prior felony conviction,
the government must accept a stipulation rather than introduce the name and nature of the prior offense if doing so avoids unfair
prejudice. The case illustrates how judges compare probative value with the danger of juror misuse.

## Strategic considerations

- Frame your argument around the specific Rule 403 danger at issue, backing it up with concrete examples.
- Offer less prejudicial alternatives to show reasonableness, such as stipulations, limiting instructions, or redacted exhibits.
- When opposing exclusion, emphasize the necessity of the evidence for telling a coherent story.
