Hearsay analysis rewards a structured approach. Start with whether a statement is offered for its truth, then move through declarant availability, categorical exclusions, and exceptions.

This decision tree guides you through each branch so you can reach the correct admissibility ruling while keeping testimonial statements and the Confrontation Clause on your radar.
