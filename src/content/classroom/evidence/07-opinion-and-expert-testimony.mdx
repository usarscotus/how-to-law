## Lay opinion testimony

Rule 701 permits lay witnesses to give opinions if they are rationally based on the witness’s perception, helpful to understanding
the testimony or determining a fact, and not based on specialized knowledge. Common examples include estimating speed, identifying
someone’s emotions, or valuing familiar property.

Lay opinions cannot substitute for expert testimony when specialized knowledge is required, and courts police the boundary
carefully in cases involving technical or scientific matters.

## Expert qualifications and reliability

Rule 702 allows experts qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to testify if:

1. The testimony will help the trier of fact.
2. It is based on sufficient facts or data.
3. It is the product of reliable principles and methods.
4. The expert reliably applied those principles and methods to the case.

Judges serve as gatekeepers under *Daubert* and *Kumho Tire*, considering factors such as testability, peer review, error rate,
standards, and general acceptance. Flexibility is key; not every factor applies in every case.

## Disclosures and procedure

Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires expert reports in many civil cases, detailing opinions, bases, exhibits,
qualifications, and prior testimony. Failure to comply can lead to exclusion. Pretrial motions in limine often seek to strike
experts for methodological flaws or inadequate disclosure.

### Examining experts

- **Direct examination**: establish qualifications, explain methodology, and walk through conclusions in accessible language.
- **Cross-examination**: probe assumptions, highlight contrary authority, and expose alternative explanations.
- **Use of hypotheticals**: ensure hypotheticals align with evidence in the record to avoid objections.

Coordinate with technical consultants early, and prepare demonstratives or visuals that help the factfinder understand complex
concepts while satisfying authentication and Rule 403 concerns.
