## Types of convictions

Rule 609 distinguishes between:

- **Felonies** (punishable by death or more than one year): admissible subject to balancing.
- **Crimes involving dishonesty or false statements**: automatically admissible, regardless of punishment, if the court finds they
  required proving—or the witness admitting—a dishonest act or false statement.

The proponent must be prepared to specify the statutory elements to show the conviction involves deceit.

## Balancing tests

For witnesses other than criminal defendants, felony convictions are admissible unless their probative value is substantially
outweighed by prejudice. When the witness is the criminal defendant, the prosecution must show the probative value outweighs its
prejudicial effect. Courts evaluate the nature of the crime, the time elapsed, similarity to the charged offense, and the
importance of the defendant’s testimony.

## Time limits and other restrictions

Convictions more than ten years old (from conviction or release, whichever is later) are admissible only if probative value
substantially outweighs prejudice and written notice is provided. Pardoned, annulled, or rehabilitated convictions are excluded if
no subsequent felony occurred. Juvenile adjudications are generally inadmissible except in limited circumstances where fairness
requires their use in criminal cases.

Prepare to present certified copies of judgments and to craft limiting instructions that confine the jury’s use of convictions to
credibility assessment.
