## Competency standards

Rule 601 presumes every person competent to testify unless a specific rule provides otherwise. Competency typically requires the
ability to perceive, remember, and communicate, and an understanding of the duty to tell the truth. Special rules address judges
and jurors, who generally cannot testify in trials over which they preside or deliberate.

Children and individuals with cognitive impairments may testify if the judge finds they can understand questions and give truthful
answers. Challenges to competency should be raised outside the jury’s presence.

## Personal knowledge and oath

Rule 602 requires witnesses to have personal knowledge of matters they testify about, demonstrated through their own testimony or
other evidence. Rule 603 mandates an oath or affirmation to impress upon the witness the duty to testify truthfully, accommodating
religious or cultural practices.

## Impeachment methods

Rule 607 permits any party to attack a witness’s credibility. Common techniques include:

- **Bias or interest**: showing relationships, benefits, or animosity.
- **Character for untruthfulness**: using opinion or reputation testimony under Rule 608(a), and specific instances of conduct on
  cross-examination under Rule 608(b).
- **Prior convictions**: admissible under Rule 609, subject to balancing tests.
- **Prior inconsistent statements**: confronting the witness with inconsistent testimony or writings.

## Rehabilitation

After impeachment, a party may rehabilitate the witness with evidence of truthful character, prior consistent statements under
Rule 801(d)(1)(B), or explanations clarifying inconsistencies. Redirect examination can provide context and neutralize attacks.

Prepare impeachment materials in advance, anticipating foundational requirements and potential objections, while ensuring
compliance with ethical rules about extrinsic evidence and collateral matters.
