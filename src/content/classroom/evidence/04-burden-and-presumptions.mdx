## Burdens of production vs. persuasion

The burden of production requires a party to introduce enough evidence for a reasonable factfinder to decide in its favor. Failure
results in judgment as a matter of law. The burden of persuasion dictates which party loses if the factfinder is left in equipoise.
Most civil cases apply a preponderance standard; criminal cases require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Presumptions under Rule 301

A presumption is an inference the law requires when a basic fact is proven. Rule 301 adopts a “bursting bubble” approach in civil
cases: once the opponent produces evidence rebutting the presumed fact, the presumption disappears, though the basic fact remains
in evidence. Some statutes assign stronger presumptions, shifting the burden of persuasion.

### Example: Mailbox presumption

Proof that a properly addressed letter was mailed gives rise to a presumption it was received. The opponent can rebut with
testimony of non-receipt or evidence of mailing errors. Judges may decide whether the presumption persists or pops depending on
jurisdictional law and the nature of the rebuttal.

## Strategic use of presumptions

- **For proponents**: Introduce clean evidence of the basic fact and highlight the policy behind the presumption. Argue that the
  opponent’s rebuttal is speculative or insufficient.
- **For opponents**: Attack the foundational fact and offer specific contrary evidence. Emphasize that once counter-evidence is
  offered, the factfinder may decide freely without the presumption.
- **Jury instructions**: Request pattern instructions that explain whether the presumption remains or disappears after rebuttal.
