## Relevance and Rule 403

Evidence must be relevant—it must make a fact of consequence more or less probable. Even relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice, confusion, or waste of time under Rule 403.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Rule 403 factors">
  Consider the availability of alternative proof, the emotional impact on jurors, and whether limiting instructions can mitigate prejudice.

## Laying a foundation

Physical and demonstrative evidence must be authenticated. Witnesses provide testimony to establish that an item is what the proponent claims. For expert testimony, courts apply the **Daubert** factors—testing, peer review, error rate, and acceptance—to ensure reliability.

## Hearsay overview

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Unless an exception applies, hearsay is inadmissible. Common exclusions and exceptions include:

- Statements offered for their effect on the listener.
- Present sense impressions and excited utterances.
- Business records kept in the ordinary course.
- Statements against interest.
