## Foundations and Rule 104

Judges decide preliminary questions of admissibility under Rule 104. For most exhibits, proponents must show relevance, personal
knowledge, and authenticity before admission. Foundational hearings may occur outside the jury’s presence when evidence raises
sensitive issues.

## Preparing foundational scripts

Identify each element required by the rules—such as ownership, condition, or chain of custody—and draft questions that elicit the
necessary testimony. Use outlines to ensure the witness covers time, place, and manner details.

### Sample checklist for photographs

1. Establish the witness’s familiarity with the scene.
2. Confirm the photograph accurately depicts the scene at the relevant time.
3. Address any changes or enhancements to the image.
4. Tie the photograph to disputed facts to demonstrate relevance.

## Handling objections

When confronted with foundational objections, request permission to ask additional questions or to present supplemental evidence.
Offer to mark exhibits for identification and defer admission until the foundation is complete. Maintain a calm, methodical
approach that reassures the judge the evidence will satisfy the rules.

Effective foundations require collaboration among attorneys, paralegals, and support staff. Conduct mock examinations and maintain
reference binders to streamline courtroom presentations.
