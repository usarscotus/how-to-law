## Authentication basics

Rule 901 requires the proponent to present evidence sufficient to support a finding that an item is what the proponent claims it is.
Methods include witness testimony with personal knowledge, distinctive characteristics, chain of custody, or expert comparison.
For digital evidence, metadata, hash values, or testimony about system reliability may be crucial.

## Self-authenticating documents

Rule 902 allows certain documents to be admitted without extrinsic evidence of authenticity, such as certified public records,
official publications, newspapers, and acknowledged documents. Business records accompanied by certification and certain electronic
data are also self-authenticating when proper notice is provided.

## Best evidence rule

Rules 1001-1004 require the original writing, recording, or photograph when proving its contents, but duplicates are generally
admissible unless a genuine question is raised about the original’s authenticity or fairness. Secondary evidence may be used when
the original is lost or destroyed (not in bad faith), cannot be obtained, or is in the possession of the opponent who fails to
produce it.

### Practice pointers

- Plan exhibit foundations in advance, specifying the witness or method to authenticate each item.
- Anticipate objections by ensuring custody records and certifications are ready.
- For voluminous records, consider summaries under Rule 1006, supported by underlying documents available for inspection.
