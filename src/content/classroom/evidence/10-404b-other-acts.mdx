## Non-propensity purposes

Rule 404(b)(2) allows evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or other acts for purposes such as motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,
plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. Courts demand a genuine, non-pretextual link between the prior
act and the issue in dispute.

## Conditional relevance standard

Under *Huddleston*, judges do not weigh credibility of the prior act evidence but decide whether a reasonable jury could find by a
preponderance that the other act occurred. The proponent must offer sufficient supporting evidence, which may include witness
accounts, documents, or corroborating circumstances.

## Balancing and procedural safeguards

Even when offered for a proper purpose, Rule 403 balancing remains critical. The more inflammatory the prior act, the greater the
probative value must be. Prosecutors in criminal cases must provide reasonable pretrial notice upon request, detailing the general
nature of the evidence.

### Practice strategies

- Proponents should articulate a clear chain of inferences showing how the prior act proves a specific element or issue.
- Opponents should propose limiting instructions and argue for exclusion of details that are unnecessary to the proper purpose.
- Consider bifurcated trials or stipulations when prior acts risk overwhelming the main case.
