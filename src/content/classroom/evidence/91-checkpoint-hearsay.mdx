quiz:
  - id: checkpoint-hearsay-definition
    prompt: "Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered:"
    options:
      - "To show its effect on the listener."

Hearsay doctrine screens out unreliable out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of what they assert. Begin with the Rule 801 definition: a statement is any oral, written, or nonverbal assertion intended as such, and hearsay applies only when offered for its truth. If the proponent offers the statement for another purpose—like effect on the listener or notice—it falls outside hearsay altogether.

Rule 801(d) removes certain statements from the hearsay label. Opposing-party statements, adoptive admissions, and prior statements of testifying witnesses (in specified circumstances) are treated as non-hearsay, meaning they are admissible without meeting an exception. When an exclusion does not apply, turn to the Rule 803 exceptions, which do not require unavailability, and Rule 804 exceptions, which do.

Key exceptions include present-sense impressions, excited utterances, statements for medical diagnosis or treatment, business records, and former testimony when the declarant is unavailable. The residual exception in Rule 807 can sometimes rescue reliable statements that do not fit elsewhere. Navigating hearsay efficiently means cycling through the definition, exclusions, and core exceptions before resorting to residuary arguments.
