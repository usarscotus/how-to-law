Character evidence problems require attention to both purpose and method. The rules distinguish between barred propensity arguments and allowed uses like motive or identity, and then dictate whether reputation, opinion, or specific acts may be shown.

This matrix lays out the choices so you can see at a glance when character is in issue, when a defendant may introduce good character, and how the prosecution may rebut.
