Take stock of the hearsay baseline by distinguishing statements offered for their truth from those offered for effect, notice, or state of mind. Rehearse the non-hearsay exclusions, especially opposing party statements and prior consistent statements, so you can dispatch threshold questions quickly.

Then run through the exception categories most likely to appear on exams—present sense impressions, excited utterances, business records, and statements against interest—considering their reliability rationale. Finish by mapping Rule 404(b)'s permissible uses to a Rule 403 balancing analysis, ensuring you can articulate a legitimate non-propensity theory alongside limiting instructions.
