## Propensity ban and its exceptions

Rule 404(a) generally prohibits using character evidence to show that a person acted in conformity with a character trait. Key
exceptions include:

- **Criminal defendant’s good character**: a defendant may offer evidence of a pertinent trait; the prosecution may rebut.
- **Victim’s character**: in homicide or assault cases, a defendant may offer evidence of the victim’s violent character; the
  prosecution may respond with evidence of the defendant’s same trait.
- **Character of witness**: governed by Rules 607-609 for truthfulness.

Civil cases rarely permit character evidence unless character itself is an essential element, such as defamation or negligent
entrustment.

## Methods of proving character

Rule 405 limits the forms character evidence may take:

- **Reputation or opinion** testimony is generally permissible when character evidence is allowed.
- **Specific instances of conduct** are permitted on cross-examination or when character is an essential element of a claim or
  defense.

Courts scrutinize the foundation for reputation testimony, ensuring familiarity with the community or relevant circle. Opinion
witnesses must explain the basis for their assessment if challenged.

## Strategic considerations

- Decide whether the benefit of opening the door to character evidence outweighs the risk of prosecution rebuttal.
- Use limiting instructions to focus the jury on non-propensity purposes, such as motive, intent, or identity.
- Prepare character witnesses for cross-examination about specific bad acts under Rule 405(a).
