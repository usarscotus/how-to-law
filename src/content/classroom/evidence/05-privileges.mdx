## Attorney-client privilege

The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between lawyer and client made for the purpose of obtaining or
providing legal advice. Key elements include:

- Communication between privileged persons.
- Intended confidentiality.
- Purpose of seeking or providing legal advice.

The privilege can be waived by voluntary disclosure to third parties, failure to maintain confidentiality, or placing the
communication “at issue.” Rule 502 offers clawback protections for inadvertent disclosures if reasonable steps were taken to
prevent and rectify the error.

## Work-product doctrine

Distinct from privilege, the work-product doctrine shields materials prepared in anticipation of litigation by or for attorneys.
Opinion work product—mental impressions and legal theories—receives heightened protection. Opponents may obtain ordinary work
product upon showing substantial need and undue hardship in obtaining the substantial equivalent.

## Other privileges

Federal courts generally recognize privileges rooted in common law, guided by Rule 501. Common examples include:

- **Spousal communications**: protecting confidential marital communications.
- **Spousal testimonial privilege**: permitting a spouse to refuse to testify in criminal cases, controlled by the witness spouse.
- **Psychotherapist-patient privilege**: recognized by the Supreme Court in *Jaffee v. Redmond*.
- **Clergy-penitent privilege**: covering confidential spiritual counseling.

## Exceptions and limitations

Privileges yield to exceptions such as the crime-fraud doctrine, where communications furthering or concealing a crime are not
protected. Some jurisdictions recognize public policy exceptions, including disputes between joint clients or claims of lawyer
malpractice.

When litigating privilege issues, be ready to offer privilege logs, in camera review proposals, and targeted briefs that address
both the doctrinal elements and fairness considerations.
