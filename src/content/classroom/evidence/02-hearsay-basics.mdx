## Defining hearsay

Under Rule 801(c), hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The definition turns
on three components:

1. **Statement**: oral or written assertion, or nonverbal conduct intended as an assertion.
2. **Declarant**: the person who made the statement.
3. **Purpose**: offered for its truth.

If any element is missing, the statement is not hearsay and Rule 802’s exclusion does not apply.

## Statements that are not hearsay by definition

Certain statements avoid hearsay problems because they are not offered for their truth:

- Effect on the listener (e.g., to show notice or motive).
- Verbal acts that have independent legal significance, such as contract offers or defamatory words.
- Impeachment statements showing inconsistency without relying on truth.

<Callout kind="note" title="Multiple levels of hearsay">
  Each layer of out-of-court statement must independently satisfy a hearsay exclusion or exception. Analyze each level and
  articulate the applicable rule.
</Callout>

## Rule 801(d) exclusions

Some statements are defined as “not hearsay” even though they would otherwise fit the definition:

- Prior inconsistent statements made under oath at a proceeding.
- Prior consistent statements to rebut a charge of fabrication or improper motive.
- Prior identifications of a person after perceiving them.
- Opposing party statements, including adoptive admissions and statements by authorized agents.

## Responding to hearsay objections

When objecting, move quickly: stand, identify the statement, cite Rule 802, and explain why the statement is offered for its
truth. When responding, articulate the non-hearsay purpose or the specific rule that admits the statement. Judges expect concise,
rule-based answers rather than broad policy appeals.
