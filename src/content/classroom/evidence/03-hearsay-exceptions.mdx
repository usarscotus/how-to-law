## Rule 803 exceptions (availability immaterial)

Rule 803 admits certain statements regardless of whether the declarant is available to testify. Key categories include:

- **Present sense impressions**: descriptions of events while perceiving them or immediately thereafter.
- **Excited utterances**: statements made under the stress of a startling event.
- **Statements for medical diagnosis or treatment**: describing medical history or symptoms relevant to care.
- **Business records**: records made in the regular course of business, by someone with knowledge, and kept routinely.
- **Public records**: observations and reports of public offices, with limits for criminal cases.

Each exception reflects a reliability rationale—spontaneity, professional duty, or systematic recordkeeping—that substitutes for
the oath and cross-examination.

## Rule 804 exceptions (declarant unavailable)

Rule 804 applies only if the declarant is unavailable due to privilege, refusal, memory loss, death or illness, or absence despite
reasonable efforts to procure them. Major exceptions:

- **Former testimony**: given under oath in a prior proceeding, with a similar motive and opportunity for cross-examination.
- **Statements against interest**: exposing the declarant to civil or criminal liability, with corroboration for criminal cases.
- **Dying declarations**: statements about the cause or circumstances of impending death, in homicide prosecutions or civil cases.
- **Statements of personal or family history**: regarding pedigree or relationship facts.

## Residual exception and Confrontation Clause interplay

Rule 807, the residual exception, permits admission of statements with equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness when more specific
exceptions do not apply and notice is provided. Courts use it sparingly; proponents must show materiality, necessity, and
reliability.

When a hearsay exception is invoked against a criminal defendant, consider the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause. Even if an
exception applies, testimonial statements require an opportunity for cross-examination unless forfeited by wrongdoing.

### Practice tips

- Build a record of the declarant’s unavailability through subpoenas, medical records, or detailed testimony.
- Anticipate reliability challenges—authenticate business records, establish routine practices, and confirm personal knowledge.
- When opposing, probe the timing, motive, or preparation involved in the statement to undermine trustworthiness.
