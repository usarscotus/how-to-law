Rule 703 permits experts to rely on facts or data that need not be admissible, provided they are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field. The proponent may disclose otherwise inadmissible bases to the jury only if their probative value in evaluating the opinion substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect. Courts expect counsel to tailor testimony to avoid smuggling hearsay to the factfinder.

Rule 705 allows experts to state opinions without first detailing the underlying facts, subject to cross-examination. This structure speeds trials but requires the opposing party to probe bases aggressively through voir dire, cross, or requests for a pretrial report. Judges may require disclosure if the omission risks misleading the jury.

Imagine a toxic tort case where the plaintiff's industrial hygienist relied on coworker interviews and unpublished lab reports to estimate chemical exposure. The defense moves to bar the opinion, claiming the sources are unreliable and prejudicial. The plaintiff argues the materials are standard industry references and seeks to disclose summaries to show the rigor of the analysis.

Attorneys should vet experts' reliance materials early, file motions in limine to limit prejudicial disclosures, and prepare cross-examination that highlights unsupported assumptions. When disclosure is permitted, limiting instructions and redactions help maintain the balance Rule 703 demands between probative value and unfair prejudice.
