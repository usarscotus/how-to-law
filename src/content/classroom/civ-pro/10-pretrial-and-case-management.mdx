## Scheduling and planning

Rule 16 empowers judges to issue scheduling orders after consulting with the parties during a Rule 26(f) conference. Orders typically set deadlines for joining parties, amending pleadings, completing discovery, filing motions, and preparing for trial. Modifying the schedule requires good cause and diligence.

## Pretrial submissions

Local rules often require joint pretrial statements outlining uncontested facts, contested issues, witness lists, exhibits, and pending motions. Failure to list a witness or exhibit may result in exclusion at trial absent a showing of good cause.

  Magistrate judges can oversee discovery disputes, settlement conferences, and preliminary matters, freeing district judges to focus on dispositive motions and trials.

## Managing settlement and trial readiness

Case management conferences provide opportunities to discuss ADR, phased discovery, and dispositive motion sequencing. Judges may require mediation or settlement conferences before trial. Parties should create trial binders, finalize jury instructions, and address evidentiary motions like motions in limine well before the final pretrial conference.
