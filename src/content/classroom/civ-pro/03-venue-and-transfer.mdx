## Statutory venue choices

General venue under § 1391 allows filing in any judicial district where a defendant resides if all defendants reside in the same state, where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, or, if no other district is available, where any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction.

Special venue statutes govern patent, copyright, and certain government actions. Plaintiffs should confirm no specific statute displaces § 1391.

## Transfers within the federal system

Section 1404(a) permits transfer for convenience and in the interest of justice to another district where the case could have been brought or to a district consented to by all parties. Courts weigh private factors (witness convenience, access to proof) and public factors (court congestion, local interests). When a forum-selection clause exists, **Atlantic Marine** directs courts to transfer absent extraordinary circumstances.

If the original venue is improper, § 1406 allows dismissal or transfer to a proper district. Transfer preserves filing dates and tolling, mitigating statute of limitations concerns.

## Forum non conveniens and multidistrict litigation

When the alternative forum is abroad or in state court, federal courts may dismiss under forum non conveniens if an adequate alternative forum exists and convenience strongly favors dismissal. In complex cases, parties may seek multidistrict litigation consolidation to coordinate pretrial proceedings, even though transfer for trial remains in the originating district.

Strategic venue selection can shape substantive outcomes—consider choice-of-law rules, jury pools, and local procedures when advising clients.
