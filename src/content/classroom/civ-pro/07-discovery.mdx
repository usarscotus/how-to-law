## Rule 26 framework

Discovery must be relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering importance, amount in controversy, access to information, and burden. Parties must exchange initial disclosures outlining key witnesses, documents, damages calculations, and insurance policies.

<Callout kind="warning" title="ESI preservation">
  Implement litigation holds promptly to preserve electronically stored information. Failure to do so can trigger Rule 37(e) sanctions when data is lost with intent to deprive another party of its use.

## Discovery tools

Interrogatories (Rule 33) allow written questions limited to 25 unless the court permits more. Requests for production (Rule 34) compel document and ESI production in a reasonably usable form. Rule 30 depositions provide live testimony; consider time limits and deposition protocols. Subpoenas under Rule 45 reach nonparties.

## Managing disputes and sanctions

Rule 26(c) protective orders shield sensitive information through confidentiality designations or restrictions on use. Privilege logs must describe withheld materials sufficient for other parties to assess claims of privilege without revealing the protected content.

Rule 37 authorizes motions to compel when parties fail to respond. Sanctions can range from fee-shifting to striking pleadings or default judgment. Judges expect meaningful meet-and-confer efforts before filing discovery motions.
