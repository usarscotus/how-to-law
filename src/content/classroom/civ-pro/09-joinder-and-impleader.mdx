## Joining claims and parties

Rule 18 allows plaintiffs to join multiple claims against a single defendant. Counterclaims fall under Rule 13: compulsory counterclaims arising from the same transaction or occurrence must be raised or are forfeited, while permissive counterclaims may be brought if jurisdiction exists.

Rule 20 enables permissive joinder of parties when claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence and share common legal or factual questions. Consider whether joinder affects diversity jurisdiction or complicates case management.

## Required joinder and Rule 19 analysis

Rule 19 requires joining parties necessary for complete relief or to protect their interests. Courts evaluate feasibility—service, jurisdiction, and venue—and, if joinder is impossible, determine whether the action should proceed in equity and good conscience or be dismissed.

## Impleader, interpleader, and intervention

Rule 14 allows defendants to implead third parties who may owe indemnity or contribution. Impleader claims must be derivative of the original plaintiff's claims and generally require leave of court if filed more than 14 days after serving the original answer.

Interpleader helps a stakeholder avoid multiple liability by joining competing claimants, using either Rule 22 or statutory interpleader with nationwide service. Rule 24 intervention of right applies when an intervenor claims an interest that may be impaired without participation and is not adequately represented by existing parties; permissive intervention rests in the court's discretion.
