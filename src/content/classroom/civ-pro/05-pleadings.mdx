## Drafting the complaint

Rule 8(a) requires a short and plain statement showing entitlement to relief. After *Twombly* and *Iqbal*, complaints must plead factual content that makes liability plausible—not merely possible. Allegations should distinguish facts from legal conclusions and provide concrete details supporting each element.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Use exhibits wisely">
  Incorporating contracts, emails, or other documents can bolster plausibility and allow the court to consider them on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion when attached to or referenced in the complaint.

## Heightened pleading and special matters

Rule 9(b) imposes heightened pleading for fraud or mistake—plaintiffs must state the who, what, when, where, and how of the alleged misconduct. Conditions of mind may be pleaded generally, but courts expect enough detail to put defendants on notice.

Rule 9 also addresses special damages, capacity, and official documents. Ensure complaints specifically demand punitive damages or other special categories when required by local rules.

## Responsive pleadings and motions

Defendants must respond within 21 days of service (60 days if service waived). Rule 12(b) motions can challenge jurisdiction, venue, service, and failure to state a claim. Some defenses—like lack of subject-matter jurisdiction—are never waived, while others must be raised early.

Rule 12(e) motions for more definite statement and Rule 12(f) motions to strike help manage confusing or scandalous allegations. Consider whether to answer and raise affirmative defenses, counterclaims, or crossclaims simultaneously, mindful that inconsistent defenses are permitted.
