## Certification prerequisites

Rule 23(a) requires numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. Plaintiffs must show a class large enough to make joinder impractical, common questions capable of classwide resolution, representatives whose claims align with the class, and competent counsel.

## Class types under Rule 23(b)

Certification depends on meeting one of the Rule 23(b) categories:

- **23(b)(1)** classes prevent inconsistent adjudications or protect absent parties from impairment.
- **23(b)(2)** classes seek injunctive or declaratory relief for cohesive groups.
- **23(b)(3)** classes pursue damages when common questions predominate and class litigation is superior to individual suits.

<Callout kind="info" title="Evidentiary burdens">
  Courts require a rigorous analysis with supporting evidence—expert reports, data, or policies demonstrating common treatment—before certifying a class, as emphasized in **Wal-Mart v. Dukes**.

## Notice, management, and settlement

Rule 23(c)(2) mandates the best practicable notice and opt-out opportunity for (b)(3) classes. Judges may sequence discovery, appoint lead counsel, and establish case management plans tailored to class issues. Interlocutory appeals of certification decisions are available under Rule 23(f).

Settlements require court approval after a fairness hearing. Parties must submit detailed agreements, plan-of-allocation proposals, and attorney fee requests. Objectors may challenge the adequacy and fairness of the settlement before final approval.
