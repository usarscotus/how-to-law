## Sources of personal jurisdiction

A court needs statutory authorization and constitutional compliance to assert power over a defendant. State long-arm statutes may reach to the limits of due process or impose narrower bounds. In federal court, Rule 4(k) adopts the forum state's reach with limited nationwide service exceptions.

<Callout kind="info" title="Consent and waiver">
  Defendants can consent to jurisdiction through forum-selection clauses, registration statutes, or by appearing without timely objecting. Rule 12 requires asserting lack of personal jurisdiction in the first responsive filing or it is waived.

## General vs. specific jurisdiction

General jurisdiction permits suit on any claim when the defendant is "at home" in the forumâ€”typically the state of incorporation and principal place of business for corporations, or domicile for individuals. Specific jurisdiction applies when the suit arises out of or relates to the defendant's contacts with the forum.

Courts apply the **International Shoe** minimum contacts test, asking whether the defendant purposefully availed itself of the forum, whether the claim arises from those contacts, and whether exercising jurisdiction is fair and reasonable.

## Notice and service of process

Due process also requires notice reasonably calculated to inform parties of the action. Service must comply with Rule 4, using methods like personal service, substituted service at the dwelling, or waiver of service. Defective service can defeat personal jurisdiction even when minimum contacts exist.
