## Preparing for trial

Parties must finalize exhibit lists, witness outlines, and pretrial motions. Jury trials require timely demands under Rule 38; otherwise, the right may be waived. Voir dire helps identify bias, and many courts permit attorney-submitted juror questionnaires.

## Presenting the case

Opening statements frame the evidence. Direct examination should elicit narrative testimony, while cross-examination focuses on impeachment and admissions. Motions in limine secure advance evidentiary rulings. Throughout trial, counsel should make timely objections to preserve issues for appeal.

  Collaborate on joint proposed instructions and verdict forms. Rule 51 requires objections before the jury retires to preserve instructional errors.

## Post-verdict motions and judgment

After the verdict, parties may file renewed Rule 50(b) motions or seek a new trial under Rule 59 based on legal errors, evidentiary issues, or verdict weight. Courts enter final judgment under Rule 58, triggering deadlines for post-trial motions and appeal. Prevailing parties may recover taxable costs by submitting a bill of costs under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1920.
