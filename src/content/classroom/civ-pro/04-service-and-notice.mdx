## Initial service of process

Rule 4 governs service of process, requiring delivery of the summons and complaint within 90 days of filing. Plaintiffs may use personal service, leave documents at the defendant's dwelling with someone of suitable age, deliver to an authorized agent, or follow state law methods. Corporations can be served through officers or registered agents.

Failure to serve within 90 days can result in dismissal unless good cause exists. Courts may extend the deadline upon a showing of diligence and obstacles outside the plaintiff's control.

## Waiver of service and cost shifting

Plaintiffs may request waiver of service by mailing the complaint and waiver form. Defendants who decline without good cause must pay later service expenses. Waiving service extends the time to answer, giving defendants strategic breathing room while avoiding costs.

## Ongoing notice obligations

After initial service, Rule 5 governs serving papers like pleadings, discovery requests, and motions. Service can be made electronically on registered users, by mail, or by handing documents to counsel. Parties must file certificates of service documenting compliance.

Due process requires notice reasonably calculated to reach interested parties. If contact information changes, counsel should promptly update the court and opposing parties to prevent disputes over missed deadlines.
