## Rule 12 motions and early case shaping

Rule 12(b) motions attack threshold issues. Judges often permit limited jurisdictional discovery before ruling. A Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings may follow the close of pleadings and applies the same standard as Rule 12(b)(6).

## Summary judgment practice

Rule 56 allows summary judgment when no genuine dispute of material fact exists. The moving party must cite admissible evidenceâ€”depositions, affidavits, or documents. Under **Celotex**, a movant without the burden of proof can show the absence of evidence on an essential element, shifting the burden to the nonmovant to demonstrate a triable issue.

  Many districts require pinpoint citations to record evidence and statements of undisputed facts. Failure to comply can result in deemed admissions.

## Motions for judgment as a matter of law and new trials

At trial, Rule 50(a) motions preserve arguments that no reasonable jury could find for the opponent. Renewed Rule 50(b) motions and Rule 59 motions for new trial must be filed within strict deadlines after judgment. Appellate courts review Rule 50 rulings de novo but give deference to jury fact-finding when evaluating Rule 59 orders.

Understanding motion standards helps litigators gauge settlement leverage and allocate discovery resources efficiently.
