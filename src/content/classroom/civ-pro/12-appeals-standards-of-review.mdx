## Appealability and timing

Most appeals arise from final judgments under § 1291. Parties must file a notice of appeal within 30 days of entry of judgment (60 days when the United States is a party). Interlocutory appeals may proceed under § 1292, Rule 23(f), or the collateral order doctrine when delaying review would effectively deny relief.

## Preserving issues for appeal

Appellate courts decline to review issues not properly preserved. Litigators should raise objections contemporaneously, seek definitive rulings, and file post-trial motions when required. Offer of proof procedures help preserve excluded evidence for review.

## Standards of review

Understanding the standard of review shapes appellate briefing:

- **De novo** review applies to legal conclusions, allowing the appellate court to substitute its judgment.
- **Abuse of discretion** governs many procedural and evidentiary rulings, requiring a showing that the decision was unreasonable or based on incorrect legal principles.
- **Clear error** applies to factual findings after bench trials, reversing only when the appellate court has a firm conviction a mistake occurred.

Tailoring arguments to the applicable standard enhances credibility and increases the likelihood of success on appeal.
