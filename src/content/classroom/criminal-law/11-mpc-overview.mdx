## Culpability structure

The MPC introduced a four-tier mental state system—purpose, knowledge, recklessness, negligence—applicable to all material elements unless expressly otherwise. It rejects the use of "willfully" or "malice" without definition and favors clarity in statutory drafting.

## Mistake doctrines

The MPC treats **mistake of fact** as a defense if it negates the required mental state. **Mistake of law** is generally not a defense, but the MPC recognizes exceptions when the law is not known and not capable of being known, the actor reasonably relies on an official statement, or the statute requires knowledge of illegality.

## Omissions and duties

Section 2.01 requires a voluntary act but allows liability for omissions when the law imposes a duty. Duties may arise from statute, contract, relationships, voluntary assumption, or risk creation. The MPC clarifies that possession is an act if the actor knowingly procured or received the item or was aware of control for a sufficient time to terminate possession.

## Complicity and inchoate offenses

- **Section 2.06** codifies accomplice liability, requiring purpose to promote or facilitate the offense and allowing convictions even if the principal is not prosecuted.
- **Article 5** addresses attempt, solicitation, and conspiracy, adopting the substantial step test and providing renunciation defenses.

## Defenses and sentencing

The MPC codifies justification defenses in Article 3 and excuse defenses in Article 4, including the substantial capacity test for insanity. Sentencing provisions emphasize proportionality, rehabilitation, and procedural fairness, influencing modern sentencing reforms.

## Practical use

1. **Determine whether the jurisdiction follows the MPC** or a hybrid model.
2. **Use MPC commentary** to interpret ambiguous statutes or advocate for reforms.
3. **Compare MPC standards** with common-law doctrines to craft arguments for broader or narrower liability.
