## Consent frameworks

Modern statutes define sexual offenses using consent-centered language. Consent may be expressed through words or conduct, but many jurisdictions require affirmative, voluntary agreement. Lack of consent can be established through force, threat, coercion, incapacity, or when the complainant is unable to communicate willingness due to intoxication or unconsciousness.

<Callout kind="info" title="Trauma-informed approach">
  Practitioners should use respectful, person-first language when discussing survivors and accused individuals. Courtroom procedures increasingly recognize the need to minimize retraumatization while ensuring fair trials.

## Force and coercion

Traditional statutes required proof of physical force or threat of imminent harm. Reforms broadened coverage to include coercive tactics, abuse of authority, or exploitation of power imbalances. Some jurisdictions differentiate between first-degree offenses (use of a weapon or serious injury) and lesser degrees based on the presence of force.

## Capacity and age

Capacity-based provisions address individuals who cannot consent due to age, cognitive or developmental disabilities, or temporary incapacitation. Age-based offenses, such as statutory rape, often impose strict liability regarding the complainant's age, though some states allow reasonable mistake defenses.

## Evidentiary considerations

- **Rape shield laws** limit admission of complainant sexual history, with narrow exceptions to protect confrontation rights.
- **Corroboration requirements** largely have been abolished, but prosecutors still gather medical, digital, or testimonial evidence to support cases.
- **Expert testimony** may explain trauma responses or delayed reporting.

## Practical analysis

1. **Identify the governing statute** and its definition of consent, force, or coercion.
2. **Assess capacity**: age, impairment, custodial or professional relationships.
3. **Examine evidentiary rules** that shape admissibility and trial strategy.
4. **Consider defenses**: consent, mistake of fact (where available), or constitutional challenges to strict liability.
