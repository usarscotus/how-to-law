## Self-defense basics

Self-defense justifies the use of force when the actor reasonably believes it is necessary to defend against the imminent use of unlawful force. Deadly force is limited to situations involving imminent threat of death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping, or forcible sexual assault.

<Callout kind="note" title="Objective and subjective components">
  Jurisdictions vary in whether reasonableness is evaluated purely objectively, subjectively, or through a hybrid lens that considers the actor's circumstances.

## Retreat and stand-your-ground

Traditional common law imposed a duty to retreat before using deadly force if safe retreat was possible, except in one's home (**castle doctrine**). Many modern statutes eliminate the duty to retreat and provide civil immunity for lawful defensive force, though proportionality still applies.

## Defense of others and property

Defense of others generally mirrors self-defense, allowing force to protect a third person if the defender reasonably believes the third person could use self-defense. Force to protect property is more limited; deadly force is rarely permitted except to prevent certain violent felonies in the home.

## Necessity (choice of evils)

Necessity justifies conduct that avoids a greater harm when:

1. The actor faced an imminent harm.
2. The actor reasonably believed the criminal conduct would prevent the greater harm.
3. No adequate legal alternative existed.
4. The harm avoided outweighs the harm caused (a question for the factfinder or sometimes the court).

The MPC allows necessity if the harm avoided is greater, regardless of imminence, but disallows the defense when the legislature has made a contrary determination.

## Practical steps

1. **Identify the type of justification** claimed: self-defense, defense of others, defense of property, or necessity.
2. **Break down statutory elements** and burdens of proof.
3. **Assess evidence** of imminence, proportionality, and reasonable belief.
4. **Consider limitations**: aggressor rules, retreat requirements, or explicit statutory exclusions.
