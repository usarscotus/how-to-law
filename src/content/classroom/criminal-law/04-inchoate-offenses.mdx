## Attempt

Attempt liability bridges the gap between preparation and completion. Jurisdictions use various tests to determine when conduct crosses the line:

- **Physical proximity**: The defendant must be near completion of the substantive offense.
- **Dangerous proximity**: Focuses on the gravity of the offense and the likelihood of success absent interruption.
- **Unequivocality (res ipsa loquitur)**: Conduct that unambiguously demonstrates criminal intent.

The MPC employs the **substantial step** test, requiring purposeful conduct constituting a substantial step strongly corroborative of criminal purpose (e.g., lying in wait, reconnoitering, possessing specially designed materials).

Defenses include **voluntary abandonment** before completing the offense and **impossibility**. Pure legal impossibility—where the actor's goal is not criminal—is a defense; factual impossibility generally is not.

## Solicitation

Solicitation involves intentionally encouraging, requesting, or commanding another person to commit a crime with the specific intent that the crime be committed. The offense is complete upon communication; the solicited person's response is immaterial. Under the MPC, renunciation is a defense if the solicitor prevents the commission of the crime under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation.

## Conspiracy

Conspiracy punishes agreements to commit unlawful acts. Elements typically include an agreement between two or more persons, intent to enter the agreement, and intent that the object crime be accomplished. Many jurisdictions require an overt act in furtherance, though the MPC requires an overt act only for misdemeanors and lesser felonies.

Conspirators are liable for substantive offenses committed by co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable—known as the **Pinkerton** doctrine. Withdrawal may limit future liability if the defendant timely communicates repudiation to co-conspirators or law enforcement.

## Merger and punishment

Attempt and solicitation generally merge into the completed offense; conspiracy usually does not merge, reflecting its independent social harm. Sentencing often scales with the underlying offense, though some statutes reduce inchoate grades (e.g., attempt punished one step lower than the completed crime).

## Practice pointers

1. **Identify the object offense** and determine whether the inchoate doctrine applies.
2. **Assess act and mental elements** under the applicable test.
3. **Evaluate defenses** such as abandonment, impossibility, or withdrawal.
4. **Consider merger** to avoid double punishment.
