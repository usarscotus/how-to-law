## Purposes of punishment

Sentencing decisions reflect multiple goals. **Retribution** focuses on moral desert; **deterrence** seeks to prevent future offenses (general and specific); **incapacitation** protects the public by restraining offenders; **rehabilitation** aims to reform individuals through treatment or education. Statutes and guidelines often balance these aims.

## Statutory frameworks and guidelines

Legislatures set maximum penalties and sometimes mandatory minimums. Sentencing guidelines—federal and state—provide advisory or binding ranges based on offense severity and criminal history. Judges must consider guideline recommendations but may depart when justified by statutory factors.

<Callout kind="info" title="Mandatory minimums">
  Mandatory minimum sentences limit judicial discretion. Advocates often seek safety-valve provisions or prosecutorial discretion to avoid disproportionate outcomes.

## Mitigation and aggravation

Courts weigh aggravating factors such as victim vulnerability, use of weapons, or leadership roles. Mitigating factors include acceptance of responsibility, lack of prior record, cooperation, or demonstrated rehabilitation. Presentence reports compile these facts, and parties may submit memoranda advocating specific outcomes.

## Appellate review

Sentences are reviewed for procedural and substantive reasonableness (federal) or abuse of discretion (many states). Errors in guideline calculations, failure to consider relevant factors, or reliance on impermissible considerations can trigger remand.

## Practice focus

1. **Identify statutory ranges** and any mandatory minimums.
2. **Calculate guideline exposure** where applicable.
3. **Gather mitigation evidence**: personal history, community support, treatment efforts.
4. **Preserve objections** to ensure appellate review of adverse rulings.
