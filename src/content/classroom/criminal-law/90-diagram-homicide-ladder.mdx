Homicide doctrine often feels like a jumble of labels. Visualizing the progression from intentional killings to involuntary manslaughter clarifies how mental state, provocation, and risk awareness affect grading.

The timeline highlights key decision points—intent, provocation, recklessness, and negligence—so you can quickly slot a fact pattern into the right offense and anticipate defenses.
