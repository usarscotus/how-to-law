## Murder and malice aforethought

At common law, **murder** is an unlawful killing with malice aforethought. Malice may be express—an intent to kill—or implied through intent to cause grievous bodily harm, depraved-heart recklessness, or killings committed during enumerated felonies (felony murder). Statutes often divide murder into degrees: first-degree involving premeditation, deliberation, or specific circumstances (e.g., lying in wait); second-degree encompassing other malicious killings.

The MPC abandons malice language, defining murder as purposeful or knowing killings, or reckless killings manifesting extreme indifference to human life. Extreme indifference may be presumed when the actor is engaged in certain felonies.

## Manslaughter and mitigation

Voluntary manslaughter mitigates what would otherwise be murder. Common law recognizes **heat of passion** upon adequate provocation, requiring a sudden reaction without time to cool off. Modern jurisdictions broaden provocation, focusing on whether a reasonable person would lose self-control. The MPC adopts **extreme emotional disturbance (EED)**, assessed from the viewpoint of a person in the actor's situation with a reasonable explanation or excuse.

Involuntary manslaughter generally involves reckless or criminally negligent killings, such as during unlawful acts not rising to felony murder or negligent handling of dangerous instruments.

## Negligent homicide and vehicular offenses

Many jurisdictions create separate offenses for negligent homicide or vehicular homicide. These statutes typically require proof of gross negligence or recklessness, sometimes tied to traffic violations, intoxication, or operation of commercial vehicles.

## Aggravating and mitigating circumstances

Sentencing and charging decisions may depend on statutory aggravators (e.g., killing a peace officer, murder for hire) and mitigators (e.g., youth, lack of prior record). Capital jurisdictions require proof of specific aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt before imposing death.

## Analytical framework

1. **Identify the homicide category** charged or potentially chargeable.
2. **Analyze mental state**: intent, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence.
3. **Consider mitigation**: provocation, EED, imperfect defenses.
4. **Evaluate felony-murder or aggravated factors** that may elevate the charge.
5. **Address causation** and defenses such as self-defense or accident.
