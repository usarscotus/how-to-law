## Common-law theft categories

- **Larceny**: Trespassory taking and carrying away of personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive. Key issues include possession versus custody and the timing of intent.
- **Embezzlement**: Fraudulent conversion of property by one already in lawful possession. Often arises with employees or fiduciaries.
- **False pretenses**: Obtaining title by intentional misrepresentation of past or existing fact with intent to defraud.

## Modern consolidation

Many jurisdictions adopt unified theft statutes combining these offenses. The MPC defines theft as unlawful taking or exercise of unlawful control over movable property with purpose to deprive, or deception to obtain property. Grading often depends on value, weapon involvement, or victim characteristics.

## Defenses and issues

- **Claim of right**: A good-faith belief of entitlement, even if mistaken, can negate intent in some jurisdictions.
- **Entrapment**: Government inducement and lack of predisposition may bar conviction.
- **Abandonment and lost property**: Determine whether property was truly abandoned or merely lost to evaluate the owner's rights.

## Practice approach

1. **Identify the property interest**: possession, title, services, or intangible rights.
2. **Match facts to offense elements**: consider how the defendant obtained or retained property.
3. **Calculate value** for grading purposes.
4. **Evaluate defenses**: claim of right, consent, entrapment, or statutory exceptions.
