## Insanity standards

Insanity excuses criminal conduct when mental disease or defect impairs culpability. Major tests include:

- **M'Naghten**: The defendant did not know the nature and quality of the act or did not know it was wrong.
- **Irresistible impulse**: Supplements M'Naghten, excusing defendants unable to control their conduct.
- **Durham (product test)**: Conduct is excused if it was the product of mental disease or defect (largely abandoned).
- **MPC substantial capacity**: Lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of conduct or to conform conduct to the law.

Procedurally, defendants bear the burden of production; burdens of persuasion vary. Commitment to mental health treatment may follow acquittal.

## Duress

Duress excuses conduct compelled by an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm where a reasonable person would have yielded. The threat must be unlawful and present; many jurisdictions disallow duress for intentional homicide, while the MPC permits it if a person of reasonable firmness would succumb.

## Infancy

Common law presumed children under seven incapable of crime; those between seven and fourteen were rebuttably presumed incapable. Modern statutes set juvenile court jurisdictional ages but allow transfer to adult court for serious offenses. Capacity assessments consider maturity and understanding of wrongfulness.

## Intoxication

- **Voluntary intoxication** may negate specific intent but rarely constitutes a complete defense. Many jurisdictions restrict its use, especially for recklessness or negligence crimes.
- **Involuntary intoxication**—coerced, prescribed, or pathological—can excuse conduct if it produces a state akin to insanity.

## Practice steps

1. **Identify the claimed excuse** and applicable statutory or common-law test.
2. **Evaluate evidentiary burdens** and procedural requirements (e.g., notice of insanity defense).
3. **Assess whether the defense negates mens rea or provides an affirmative excuse.**
4. **Consider policy arguments**: fairness, deterrence, and public safety.
