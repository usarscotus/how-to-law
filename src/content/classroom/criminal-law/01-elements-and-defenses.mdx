## Building blocks of an offense

Every crime contains an **actus reus** (a prohibited act) and a **mens rea** (culpable mental state). Some crimes also require result causation or attendant circumstances, such as the value of property in a theft case. Prosecutors must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt.

Mens rea terms signal the level of culpability:

- **Purposefully**: The actor’s conscious object is to cause a particular result.
- **Knowingly**: The actor is aware that the result is practically certain.
- **Recklessly**: The actor consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk.
- **Negligently**: The actor should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk.

## Defenses

Defenses fall into two broad categories:

- **Justification**: The defendant admits the conduct but claims it was socially acceptable under the circumstances (self-defense, defense of others, necessity).
- **Excuse**: The defendant asserts they should not be blamed (insanity, duress, infancy).

Some defenses shift the burden of production to the defendant, while the prosecution retains the burden of persuasion once the issue is raised.

<Callout kind="info" title="Statutory interpretation matters">
  Criminal statutes are strictly construed under the rule of lenity. Ambiguities favor the defendant, particularly when legislative intent is unclear.

## Applying doctrine

When analyzing a criminal problem, create a chart of elements and map facts to each element. Identify potential affirmative defenses and whether the jurisdiction recognizes them. Remember to evaluate causation when a result is required; intervening acts may break the chain if they are unforeseeable.
