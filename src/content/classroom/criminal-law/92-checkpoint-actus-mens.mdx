Start with actus reus: identify voluntary acts, omissions coupled with duties, and the necessary attendant circumstances that frame liability. Test your ability to parse fact patterns for acts that appear involuntary and remember when status crimes fail constitutional scrutiny.

Then match culpable mental states to statutes using both common law labels and MPC hierarchy. Confirm you can analyze purpose, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence, align them with result versus conduct elements, and connect actus reus to mens rea through concurrence and causation sequencing.
