## Elements of accomplice liability

An accomplice is one who, with the requisite mental state, aids, abets, counsels, commands, or encourages the commission of an offense. The common law required that the accomplice share the intent that the crime be committed and provide some assistance—physical or psychological—that furthers the crime.

The MPC defines an accomplice as a person who, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the offense, solicits another to commit it, aids or agrees to aid in its commission, or has a legal duty to prevent it yet fails to act. Knowing assistance may suffice for result crimes if the accomplice acts with the kind of culpability required for the result.

## Scope of liability

Accomplices are liable for the substantive offense and any foreseeable additional crimes committed by co-felons in furtherance of the plan. Courts assess foreseeability and shared intent; liability does not extend to independent frolics outside the agreed scope.

  Modern statutes often treat accessories after the fact as separate offenses (e.g., hindering prosecution) rather than true accomplices.

## Withdrawal and termination

An accomplice may avoid liability by timely withdrawal, which generally requires repudiating the aid and taking affirmative steps to neutralize assistance or notify authorities. The MPC allows withdrawal through complete and voluntary renunciation combined with efforts to prevent the crime.

## Strategic considerations

1. **Identify the principal offense** and its elements.
2. **Determine the alleged assistance** and whether it meaningfully facilitated the crime.
3. **Assess mental state**: purpose or knowledge depending on the jurisdiction and offense.
4. **Evaluate defenses**: withdrawal, lack of agreement, or argument that the acts were mere presence or acquiescence.
