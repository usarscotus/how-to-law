## Investigation and arrest

Police interactions fall on a spectrum from consensual encounters to arrests. Under *Terry v. Ohio*, an officer may stop a person with reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and frisk for weapons if they reasonably believe the person is armed. Probable cause is required for arrests and searches of homes or vehicles, subject to exceptions.

The Fourth Amendment demands warrants supported by probable cause unless exigent circumstances, consent, or other exceptions apply. Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment may be excluded via the **exclusionary rule**.

## Charging and pretrial process

After arrest, prosecutors decide whether to charge. Federal prosecutions typically proceed by grand jury indictment; states may allow informations. Arraignment informs the defendant of charges and sets bail. Pretrial motions address discovery, suppression, and speedy trial rights.

Defendants enjoy the right to counsel, compulsory process, and confrontation. Violations can lead to dismissal or suppression of evidence.

## Trial and post-trial

Trials involve jury selection, opening statements, presentation of evidence, and jury deliberation. The prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, defendants may seek relief through motions for a new trial or appeal.
