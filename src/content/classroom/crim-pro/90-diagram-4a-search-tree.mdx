Fourth Amendment analysis always starts with whether there was a search or seizure, then turns to the warrant preference, and finally to exceptions or remedies. Mapping the decision points helps keep doctrinal tests straight.

This decision tree illustrates the sequence from state action through probable cause, warrant requirements, and common exceptions like consent, exigency, and the automobile doctrine.
