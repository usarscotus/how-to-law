## Custody and interrogation

Miranda safeguards apply to custodial interrogation. Custody exists when a reasonable person in the suspect's position would not feel free to end the questioning. Interrogation includes express questioning and its functional equivalentâ€”words or actions police should know are likely to elicit an incriminating response. Routine booking questions and volunteered statements fall outside Miranda.

## Warnings, waiver, and invocation

Before custodial interrogation, police must advise the suspect of the right to remain silent, that statements can be used in court, the right to counsel, and that counsel will be provided if indigent. A valid waiver must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.

Suspects may invoke the right to silence or counsel. Invocation of silence requires officers to scrupulously honor the decision, though questioning may resume after a significant break and new warnings. Invocation of counsel is more protective: all interrogation must stop until counsel is present unless the suspect initiates further communication.

## Fruits and impeachment

Statements obtained in violation of Miranda are generally inadmissible in the prosecution's case-in-chief. Physical evidence derived from the unwarned statement may be admissible if voluntary. Unwarned statements can sometimes be used to impeach the defendant's trial testimony if the statements were voluntary.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Voluntariness still matters">
  Even with proper warnings, involuntary statements violate the Due Process Clause and are inadmissible for any purpose. Analyze coercive tactics separately from Miranda compliance.
