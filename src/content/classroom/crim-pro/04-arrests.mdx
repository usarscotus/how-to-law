## Probable cause and location matter

Probable cause to arrest exists when facts within the officer's knowledge would lead a reasonable person to believe the suspect committed a specific offense. Officers may make warrantless arrests for felonies in public places and, in most jurisdictions, for misdemeanors committed in their presence. Entering a suspect's home requires an arrest warrant absent exigent circumstances or consent.

## Executing the arrest

Officers may use reasonable force to effect an arrest. Deadly force is limited to situations where the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious harm. Officers must promptly advise arrestees of charges and complete booking procedures consistent with department policy.

## Post-arrest obligations

After arrest, the Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause, typically within 48 hours. Arrestees have a right to counsel at critical stages and must receive Miranda warnings before custodial interrogation. Police must inventory property and ensure access to necessary medical care.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Home arrests">
  If officers arrest a suspect at home without a warrant, analyze whether an exception—such as hot pursuit or consent—applies; otherwise suppression may follow.
