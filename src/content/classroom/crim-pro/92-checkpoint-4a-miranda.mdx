Run through the Fourth Amendment decision tree: is there government action, a search or seizure, and reasonable expectation of privacy? Revisit how probable cause, reasonable suspicion, and standing operate before cataloging exceptions like exigency, consent, automobile, and special needs searches.

Switch to interrogation, focusing on custody and interrogation triggers for Miranda. Evaluate the sufficiency of warnings, valid waiver requirements, and remedies such as exclusion or impeachment use. Cross-check how the Fifth Amendment voluntariness doctrine overlays with Miranda to catch the fact pattern twists.
