## First court appearances and bail

Arrestees must be brought promptly before a magistrate for an initial appearance, where they are advised of charges, informed of rights, and counsel is appointed if necessary. Bail decisions balance risk of flight and danger to the community. Conditions may include release on recognizance, monetary bond, or detention under the Bail Reform Act.

## Charging and screening

Prosecutors may file an information or seek a grand jury indictment. Preliminary hearings test probable cause unless waived or superseded by indictment. Defendants may challenge probable cause, present limited evidence, and cross-examine witnesses.

## Discovery and motions

The government must disclose exculpatory and impeachment material under *Brady*. Rule-based discovery covers tangible evidence, expert reports, and prior statements. Defense reciprocal discovery applies when requesting similar material from the prosecution. Pretrial motions often address suppression, dismissal, change of venue, or severance.
