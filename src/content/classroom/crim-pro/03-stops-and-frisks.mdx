## Reasonable suspicion required

A stop occurs when a reasonable person would not feel free to terminate the encounter and officers restrain the individual's movement through a show of authority or physical force. The officer must have specific, articulable facts creating reasonable suspicion of criminal activity; mere hunches are insufficient. Courts look at the totality of circumstances, including location, behavior, and tips from reliable informants.

## Frisking for weapons

A frisk is a pat-down of outer clothing to detect weapons. It is justified only if the officer reasonably believes the person is armed and dangerous. Objects whose contour makes their identity immediately apparent—like contraband in a "plain feel" situation—may be seized. Once safety concerns dissipate, further manipulation of items violates the Fourth Amendment.

## Scope and duration limits

Stops must be temporary and last no longer than necessary to confirm or dispel suspicion. Moving a suspect to a police station or holding them for excessive time converts the stop into an arrest requiring probable cause. Officers may use handcuffs or place suspects in patrol cars when reasonable under the circumstances, but these steps are judged against the need for safety and the risk of flight.

  Ask: (1) Was the person seized? (2) Was reasonable suspicion present at initiation? (3) Did officers diligently pursue the investigation without unreasonably prolonging the detention?
