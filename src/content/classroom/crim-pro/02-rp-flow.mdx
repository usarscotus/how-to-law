In campaign play, you may want a tighter loop. Here's a popular RP variant that still nods to core due process ideas.

<Flow
  client:load
  steps={[
    { title: 'Accusation', description: 'A guild captain issues charges publicly—no sealed filings.' },
    {
      title: 'Council conclave',
      description: (
        <>
          All factions meet; the accused hears charges (a stand-in for <Term client:load id="arraignment" />).
        </>
      )
    },
    { title: 'Truth rite', description: 'Magical or technological device approximates probable cause review.' },
    { title: 'Negotiation interlude', description: 'Parties roleplay offers and alliances; evidence cards are exchanged.' },
    { title: 'Tribunal showdown', description: 'Decision makers hear arguments and rule immediately.' },
    { title: 'Aftermath review', description: 'A senior council reviews outcomes to maintain continuity.' }
  ]}

<Callout
  client:load
  kind="rp"
  baseline="Federal cases require arraignment and discovery before trial."
  rule="RP guild tribunals may compress arraignment and discovery into a single dramatic council scene."
/>

Tell players which safeguards still exist. If discovery is compressed, maybe evidence cards stand in for disclosures. If appeals go to a lore-heavy council, give them a name and show the political stakes.
