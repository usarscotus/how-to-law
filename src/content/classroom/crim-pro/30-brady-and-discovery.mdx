Under *Brady v. Maryland*, due process requires the prosecution to disclose material exculpatory and impeachment evidence in its possession or accessible to its team. Materiality turns on whether there is a reasonable probability the result would have differed had the evidence been disclosed. The obligation extends to police and investigative agencies working the case.

Brady duties are self-executing and do not depend on defense requests. Prosecutors must also honor statutory and rule-based discovery regimes, including timely disclosure of witness statements under *Giglio* and the Jencks Act in federal practice. Courts expect offices to maintain systems ensuring line prosecutors know what officers and labs possess.

Picture a robbery prosecution where detectives suppress surveillance footage showing the perpetrator notably shorter than the defendant. Defense counsel learns of the tape mid-trial through a whistleblower. The court must decide whether to grant a mistrial, allow a continuance, or impose sanctions on the prosecution team.

Defense attorneys should make specific discovery motions, memorialize Brady requests, and seek in camera review if red flags appear. Remedies range from continuances and evidentiary exclusions to dismissal or post-conviction relief. Prosecutors should err on the side of disclosure and document their efforts to locate favorable material.
