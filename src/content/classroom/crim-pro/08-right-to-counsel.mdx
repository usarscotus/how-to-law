## Attachment and scope

The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches once adversarial judicial proceedings begin—typically at indictment, arraignment, or the filing of formal charges. After attachment, the government may not deliberately elicit statements from the accused regarding the charged offenses without counsel present or a valid waiver.

## Critical stages

The right applies at critical stages where substantial rights may be affected: arraignments, plea negotiations, lineups after indictment, preliminary hearings, trial, sentencing, and first appeals as of right. Routine administrative steps, such as fingerprinting, are not critical stages.

## Effective representation

To prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must show deficient performance and prejudice under *Strickland v. Washington*. Prejudice is presumed when counsel is denied entirely, has an actual conflict, or fails to subject the prosecution’s case to meaningful adversarial testing.

  Courts defer to counsel’s reasonable strategic decisions; focus on objectively unreasonable errors that likely affected the outcome.
