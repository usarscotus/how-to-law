The Fourth Amendment restrains government searches and seizures, so the threshold question is whether state action invaded a reasonable expectation of privacy or trespassed on a protected area. Encounters like consensual questioning or observations from a lawful vantage point fall outside its reach. Once triggered, the Amendment demands probable cause and, absent an exception, a valid warrant issued by a neutral magistrate.

Warrants require particularity and probable cause supported by oath or affirmation. Yet officers often rely on exceptions such as exigent circumstances, consent, searches incident to arrest, automobile searches, and plain view. Each exception has precise boundaries—consent must be voluntary and within scope, exigency must be real, and automobile searches remain tied to probable cause.

When violations occur, the exclusionary rule suppresses evidence obtained directly or as “fruit of the poisonous tree,” but several safety valves limit suppression. Good-faith reliance on defective warrants, inevitable discovery, independent source, and attenuation doctrines can keep evidence admissible. Effective analysis tracks both the initial intrusion and any exception the prosecution might invoke to salvage the evidence.
