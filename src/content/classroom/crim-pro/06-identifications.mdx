## Right to counsel in lineups

After formal charges, the Sixth Amendment guarantees counsel at in-person lineups and showups. Photo arrays are excluded from this right. If counsel is absent, the identification may be suppressed unless the government proves an independent source.

## Due process challenges

Regardless of the charging stage, identifications obtained through unnecessarily suggestive procedures that create a substantial likelihood of misidentification violate due process. Courts weigh factors such as the witness's opportunity to view the suspect, attention level, accuracy of prior descriptions, certainty, and time elapsed.

## Improving reliability

Best practices include double-blind administration, sequential presentation, and clear instructions that the perpetrator may or may not be present. Prompt documentation of the witness's confidence level aids in later judicial review.

  Identify the stage of proceedings, evaluate suggestiveness, and finish by weighing reliability factors before deciding whether suppression is warranted.
