The Fifth Amendment prohibits multiple prosecutions or punishments for the same offense. Jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn or, in a bench trial, when the first witness is sworn. Once attached, an acquittal bars retrial even if the ruling is legally erroneous.

Offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes when each does not require proof of an additional fact under the *Blockburger* test. Lesser-included offenses merge into the greater, though separate sovereigns—state and federal governments or distinct states—may prosecute the same conduct independently under the dual sovereignty doctrine.

Imagine a defendant tried for armed robbery, but the judge grants a defense motion to dismiss after jeopardy attaches, citing insufficient evidence. The prosecution appeals, claiming the judge misapplied the law. The defendant argues double jeopardy bars any retrial because the dismissal was functionally an acquittal on the merits.

Retrial is permitted after a mistrial declared for manifest necessity or at the defendant's request, and successful prosecution appeals may lead to a new trial unless an acquittal occurred. Sentencing enhancements based on prior conduct generally do not trigger double jeopardy, but multiple punishments in a single proceeding must reflect legislative intent.
