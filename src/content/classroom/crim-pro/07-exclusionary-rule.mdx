## Core rule

The exclusionary rule suppresses evidence obtained in violation of the Constitution. It is primarily a deterrent remedy and does not apply in grand jury proceedings, certain civil cases, or parole revocation hearings. Standing requires the defendant to show their own rights were violated.

## Fruits and attenuation

The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine extends suppression to derivative evidence unless the government shows an independent source, inevitable discovery, or attenuation. Independent source asks whether officers later obtained the evidence from a lawful, untainted avenue. Inevitable discovery requires proof that lawful procedures already in motion would have uncovered the evidence. Attenuation considers temporal proximity, intervening circumstances, and the flagrancy of misconduct.

## Exceptions

Good-faith reliance on defective warrants, clerical errors, or binding appellate precedent can save evidence. The impeachment exception allows the prosecution to use illegally obtained statements to impeach the defendant's testimony if voluntary. Violations that are negligent but not deliberate or reckless may weigh against suppression when deterrence benefits are minimal.

  Always tie the remedy to the specific constitutional violation and ask whether an exception applies before predicting the outcome.
