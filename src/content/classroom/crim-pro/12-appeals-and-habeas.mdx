## Direct appeals

Convicted defendants may pursue direct appeals as of right in most jurisdictions. Timely notice is essential. Issues not preserved by objection may face plain-error review, which requires showing a clear error affecting substantial rights. Appeals focus on the trial record; new evidence generally cannot be introduced.

## Post-trial motions

Before appealing, defendants may file motions for a new trial or for judgment of acquittal. These motions toll appeal deadlines and allow the trial court to correct errors. Sentencing errors can be challenged through direct appeal or motions to correct sentences, depending on the jurisdiction.

## Habeas corpus

Collateral review through federal habeas corpus is available after exhausting state remedies. Under AEDPA, relief is limited to decisions that are contrary to or involve unreasonable applications of clearly established Supreme Court precedent, or that rest on unreasonable factual determinations. Procedural default bars claims unless the petitioner shows cause and prejudice or actual innocence.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Mind the deadlines">
  Strict statutes of limitation govern both appeals and habeas petitions; missing a filing deadline can foreclose review entirely.
