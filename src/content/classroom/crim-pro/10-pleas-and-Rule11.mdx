## Plea bargaining landscape

The vast majority of criminal cases resolve through negotiated pleas. Prosecutors may offer charge reductions, sentencing recommendations, or agreements on factual stipulations. Defense counsel must relay offers and advise the client regarding risks and benefits. Courts review agreements but generally defer to the parties' bargaining so long as the plea is voluntary and supported by a factual basis.

## Rule 11 colloquy

Before accepting a guilty plea in federal court, the judge must ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charge, mandatory minimum and maximum penalties, trial rights being waived, and immigration or collateral consequences when required. The judge must determine that the plea is voluntary and supported by an independent factual basis. Similar procedures apply in most states.

## Using plea statements

Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) bar the admission of withdrawn guilty pleas, pleas later vacated, and statements made during plea discussions with prosecutors if those discussions did not result in a guilty plea or resulted in a withdrawn plea. Limited exceptions allow such statements for perjury prosecutions or when fairness requires considering related statements.
