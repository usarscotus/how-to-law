## Public, speedy, and impartial trials

Defendants have a right to a public trial, subject to limited closures when essential to protect higher values. Speedy trial claims weigh the length of delay, reasons, assertion of the right, and prejudice. Venue ordinarily lies where the crime occurred, though transfer is possible for prejudice concerns.

## Jury selection and structure

Serious offenses carry a right to a jury trial. Juries must be drawn from a fair cross-section of the community. During voir dire, parties may strike for cause and exercise a limited number of peremptories, which cannot be used discriminatorily under *Batson*. Judges instruct jurors on the burden of proof and elements of the offense.

## Confrontation and compulsory process

The Confrontation Clause guarantees cross-examination of testimonial witnesses unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross. Hearsay rules interface with this requirement. Compulsory process allows defendants to secure witnesses and evidence in their favor.

  Some violations—like denial of counsel or a biased judge—require automatic reversal; others undergo harmless error review. Always identify which applies.
