Substantive due process recognizes that the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments safeguard more than procedural fairness; they also protect certain fundamental liberties from government intrusion. Historical precedents and deeply rooted traditions guide courts in determining which rights merit heightened protection. The methodology emphasizes ordered liberty and historical practice rather than personal policy preferences.

When a law infringes a fundamental right, courts apply strict scrutiny, demanding that the government prove the law is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. Rights such as marriage, procreation, bodily integrity, and family autonomy have often received this elevated status. Conversely, regulations that do not implicate fundamental rights are reviewed under rational basis scrutiny, which is highly deferential.

The Supreme Court's approach has evolved across eras. Early twentieth-century decisions invoked substantive due process to strike down economic regulations, but *West Coast Hotel v. Parrish* repudiated that Lochner-era focus. In modern times, cases like *Lawrence v. Texas* and *Obergefell v. Hodges* recognized liberty interests tied to personal autonomy and dignity, while *Dobbs v. Jackson Womenâ€™s Health Organization* emphasized historical analysis in rejecting a claimed right to abortion.

Attorneys litigating substantive due process claims must frame the asserted right carefully, marshalling historical sources, precedent, and practical impacts. Because the doctrine invites debate about judicial role and democratic decision-making, persuasive advocacy often addresses both legal tests and broader themes about constitutional interpretation.
