The Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine infers from the Commerce Clause that states may not enact laws that discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce. Even without federal legislation, the national market must remain free from parochial protectionism that undermines economic unity. Courts assess the purpose and effect of state regulations to determine whether they target out-of-state interests.

Facially discriminatory measures almost always fail. A state law that taxes out-of-state goods more heavily or prohibits importation of waste, for example, must survive strict scrutiny by showing it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be served through non-discriminatory means. Only rare cases, such as quarantine laws necessary to prevent disease, have satisfied this standard.

Neutral regulations that incidentally burden interstate commerce are evaluated under the *Pike v. Bruce Church* balancing test. Courts weigh the local benefits against the burden on interstate commerce, invalidating the law only when the burden is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. This deferential review respects state authority over health and safety while preserving national trade.

States retain some leeway through the market participant exception, which allows them to favor local interests when acting as buyers or sellers rather than regulators. Additionally, Congress may authorize state actions that would otherwise violate dormant Commerce Clause principles. Practitioners must analyze the nature of the regulation, available alternatives, and any congressional approval before predicting outcomes.
