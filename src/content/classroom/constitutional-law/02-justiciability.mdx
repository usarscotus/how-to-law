Article III cabins federal judicial power to actual disputes, and the Supreme Court has crafted justiciability doctrines to enforce that constraint. Litigants must demonstrate a concrete stake in the outcome before a court may exercise jurisdiction. Without these limits, courts would risk issuing advisory opinions, intruding on the roles of Congress and the executive.

Standing doctrine demands an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent. The injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Individuals cannot assert generalized grievances shared by the public, and third-party standing is rarely permitted unless there is a close relationship and an obstacle to the third party's ability to sue.

Ripeness addresses whether a dispute has matured enough to warrant judicial intervention. Courts assess the fitness of the issues for decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding review. Pre-enforcement challenges are sometimes ripe when a credible threat of prosecution chills constitutional rights, particularly in First Amendment cases. By contrast, disputes contingent on future events may be dismissed as unripe.

Mootness ensures that a live controversy persists throughout the litigation. If intervening events resolve the dispute or the plaintiff no longer faces the challenged harm, courts typically dismiss the case. Exceptions exist for controversies capable of repetition yet evading review, voluntary cessation by defendants, and certified class actions where some members retain a live interest.

The political question doctrine reflects a prudential judgment that some issues are textually committed to other branches or lack judicially manageable standards. The *Baker v. Carr* factors guide courts in identifying such cases, though the Court has been selective in invoking the doctrine. For example, partisan gerrymandering claims were deemed nonjusticiable in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, while disputes over war powers or impeachment procedures usually remain off limits.

Justiciability principles both protect separation of powers and frustrate litigants seeking constitutional rulings. Advocates must meticulously plead jurisdictional facts, anticipate government challenges, and understand how prudential concerns may steer judges away from addressing merits questions.
