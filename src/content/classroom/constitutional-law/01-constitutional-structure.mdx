## Separation of powers

The Constitution distributes federal power across three branches. Article I grants legislative authority to Congress, including the necessary and proper power to implement enumerated powers. Article II vests executive power in the President, who enforces the law and directs the administrative state. Article III gives the judiciary the authority to decide cases and controversies.

Checks and balances prevent any branch from aggrandizing itself. Congress controls appropriations and can structure inferior courts. The President may veto legislation but faces Senate confirmation of appointments. The judiciary polices the constitutional boundaries through **judicial review**.

## Federalism

Federalism reserves general police power to the states while granting the federal government enumerated powers. Congress relies on the Commerce Clause, Spending Clause, and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to legislate broadly, yet cannot commandeer state officials or violate constitutional rights.

States retain authority over areas such as property law, family law, and criminal enforcement, subject to federal preemption when Congress validly occupies a field. Supremacy Clause analysis asks whether federal law expressly or impliedly displaces state regulation.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Federalism analysis roadmap">
  1. Identify the relevant federal statute or constitutional provision.
  2. Determine whether Congress has enumerated authority to act.
  3. Assess whether the state law conflicts with or frustrates the federal scheme.

## Judicial review and standards of scrutiny

In *Marbury v. Madison*, the Supreme Court held that courts must disregard statutes that contradict the Constitution. This power of judicial review ensures that the Constitution remains supreme law.

When courts evaluate government action, they apply tiers of scrutiny:

- **Rational basis**: Government action is presumed valid if rationally related to a legitimate interest.
- **Intermediate scrutiny**: The law must substantially relate to an important interest, often used for gender classifications.
- **Strict scrutiny**: The government must show a compelling interest and narrow tailoring, typically triggered by fundamental rights or suspect classifications.

Understanding which tier applies is critical to predicting outcomes.
