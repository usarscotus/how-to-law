Forum analysis helps courts balance free speech access against government control of property. Once you classify a forum, you know whether strict scrutiny or a more deferential reasonableness test applies to restrictions on expressive activity.

Use the matrix to visualize how forum type, the nature of the restriction, and permissible government interests interact. It offers quick reminders about content neutrality, viewpoint discrimination, and the government speech doctrine.
