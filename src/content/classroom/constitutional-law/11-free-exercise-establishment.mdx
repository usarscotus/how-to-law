The Free Exercise Clause protects individuals from laws that target religious practice. Under *Employment Division v. Smith*, neutral laws of general applicability receive rational basis review even if they incidentally burden religious exercise. However, the Court requires strict scrutiny when the government exhibits hostility toward religion, enforces individualized exemptions, or burdens both religious exercise and another constitutional right.

Recent decisions have expanded protections. In *Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah*, the Court struck down ordinances targeting Santería rituals, emphasizing neutrality. Cases like *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* and *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* continue to scrutinize governmental motives and accommodations, suggesting potential shifts away from *Smith*.

The Establishment Clause restrains government endorsement of religion. Traditional tests include the *Lemon v. Kurtzman* three-part framework—purpose, effect, and entanglement—and the endorsement and coercion tests. More recently, the Court has emphasized historical practices and understandings, focusing on whether government actions align with longstanding traditions rather than abstract neutrality.

Balancing the two clauses requires sensitivity to context. Governments may accommodate religion without violating the Establishment Clause, but they must avoid coercion or favoritism. Practitioners should examine statutory exemptions, historical analogues, and the specific burdens imposed to craft persuasive arguments on either side of religion cases.
