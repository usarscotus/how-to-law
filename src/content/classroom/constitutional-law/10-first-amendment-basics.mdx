The First Amendment prohibits government abridgment of freedom of speech, but courts distinguish among categories of expression. Political speech and public debate receive the highest protection, whereas obscenity, incitement, true threats, and defamation fall outside the core. Intermediate categories like commercial speech or expressive conduct receive tailored analysis reflecting the government interests at stake.

Content-based regulations—those targeting speech because of its message—are presumptively invalid and subject to strict scrutiny. The government must demonstrate the regulation is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. Content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions, by contrast, are assessed under intermediate scrutiny so long as they are narrowly tailored, leave open ample alternative channels, and serve significant governmental interests.

Prior restraints, such as injunctions or licensing schemes that prevent speech before it occurs, are particularly suspect. The Supreme Court demands procedural safeguards to avoid censorship, requiring prompt decisions, clear standards, and judicial review. Even in national security contexts, the heavy presumption against prior restraints frames the analysis.

Mastering these basic doctrines equips advocates to assess the constitutionality of speech regulations, evaluate the appropriate level of scrutiny, and craft arguments that respect both expressive freedom and legitimate governmental objectives.
