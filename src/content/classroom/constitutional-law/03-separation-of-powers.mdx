Article I vests legislative power in Congress, authorizing it to craft laws, regulate commerce, declare war, and appropriate funds. Article II assigns executive power to the President, who enforces laws, commands the military, and conducts foreign affairs. Article III grants judicial power to the courts to resolve cases and controversies. The structural design prevents any branch from monopolizing governance by dispersing core functions.

Checks and balances fortify this distribution. The President wields the veto, yet Congress may override it with supermajorities and controls the purse. The Senate confirms executive and judicial appointments, while the House may impeach and the Senate tries impeachments. Courts review legislative and executive actions for constitutional compliance, reinforcing the supremacy of the Constitution.

Modern disputes illustrate these tensions. In *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, the Court curtailed presidential seizure of steel mills absent congressional authorization. Conversely, cases like *INS v. Chadha* invalidated legislative vetoes that encroached on executive execution of the law. The resulting jurisprudence encourages branches to negotiate, legislate carefully, and respect procedural safeguards.

Congress can shape the executive and judicial spheres through statute, but it may not aggrandize itself or impair another branch's core functions. Similarly, the President may supervise executive officers but cannot defy statutory limits without constitutional justification. Appreciating these boundaries equips practitioners to analyze executive privilege disputes, appointment challenges, and legislative oversight battles.
