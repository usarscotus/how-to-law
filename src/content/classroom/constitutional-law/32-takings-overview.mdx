The Takings Clause forbids government from taking private property for public use without just compensation. A categorical taking occurs when the state permanently appropriates property or authorizes physical invasions, as seen in *Loretto* and *Horne*. Temporary occupations may trigger liability when they effectively deny owners the right to exclude.

Regulatory actions become takings when they go too far. Total economic wipeouts generally qualify under *Lucas*, while partial restrictions require the ad hoc *Penn Central* balancing of economic impact, interference with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. Programmatic adjustments spreading burdens across the public are less likely to be deemed takings.

Suppose a coastal town requires homeowners to allow public beach access over their lots as a permit condition. The homeowners argue a physical invasion and lack of rough proportionality to the development impact. The town responds that the easement mitigates crowding and mirrors neighboring access points.

Litigation turns on defining the relevant property interest, demonstrating distinct investment-backed expectations, and documenting feasible public-use justifications. Compensation normally equals fair market value at the time of the taking, though governments may defend projects by showing reciprocity of advantage or by offering alternative mitigation measures.
