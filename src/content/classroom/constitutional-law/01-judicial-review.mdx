The Constitution does not explicitly grant courts the power to disregard unconstitutional statutes, yet the structure of the document implies that courts must give effect to the supreme law. Article VI declares the Constitution the "supreme Law of the Land," binding judges in every state. When Congress legislates beyond its enumerated powers or infringes protected rights, the judiciary must decide which law governs a dispute. This interpretive role inevitably leads courts to refuse enforcement of conflicting statutes.

Chief Justice John Marshall cemented that implication in *Marbury v. Madison*. The Court held that it would violate the very essence of written constitutions if judges lacked authority to set aside inconsistent laws. Marshall reasoned that a government of limited powers depends on a judicial branch that can police boundaries. Without judicial review, Congress could enlarge its own authority merely by enacting statutes that ignore constitutional constraints.

Judicial review is not a license to roam freely through public policy. Article III confines federal courts to actual "Cases" and "Controversies," meaning there must be a concrete dispute with parties who have standing to sue. Courts demand injury in fact, causation, and redressability before they pronounce constitutional judgments. Advisory opinions, generalized grievances, and third-party claims are largely off limits, preserving the separation between judicial and political branches.

Even when jurisdiction is secure, courts exercise remedial restraint. They prefer narrow rulings, such as deciding cases on statutory grounds or fashioning limited injunctions, to avoid unnecessary clashes with the political branches. The doctrine of constitutional avoidance encourages judges to interpret statutes in ways that sidestep serious constitutional problems when possible. These practices support the judiciary's legitimacy and acknowledge that elected branches carry the primary responsibility for policymaking.

Judicial review also shapes the relationship between the federal government and the states. Through supremacy clause analysis, courts determine whether federal statutes preempt conflicting state laws. Through enforcement of individual rights, courts scrutinize state actions alleged to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. State courts possess concurrent authority to conduct similar review when federal questions arise, ensuring constitutional norms percolate through all levels of the judiciary.

Modern cases show judicial review at work across subject areas. The Supreme Court has invalidated legislation ranging from early twentieth-century labor regulations to twenty-first-century marriage bans. It has also constrained executive actions, as in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, where the Court rejected President Truman's seizure of steel mills. Yet courts also defer to political judgments in many areas, particularly when applying rational basis review to ordinary economic regulations.

Because judicial review can affect national policy, debates persist about how aggressively courts should wield the power. Some scholars advocate judicial restraint, warning that unelected judges should rarely overturn legislation. Others argue for robust enforcement of constitutional limits to protect minorities and maintain the rule of law. The balance between these competing visions continues to define constitutional discourse.

Ultimately, judicial review functions as both sword and shield. It empowers courts to invalidate unconstitutional actions, but it also disciplines the judiciary through procedural limits, prudential doctrines, and institutional humility. Understanding the history and mechanics of the doctrine prepares advocates to frame constitutional claims persuasively and anticipate judicial skepticism.

### Mini-Hypo

Congress passes the Digital Harmony Act, authorizing warrantless collection of personal communications for national security. A privacy advocacy group sues, asserting the statute violates the Fourth Amendment. The government argues the issue is a political question because national security is entrusted to the political branches.

**Question:** Should the court hear the case, and if so, what framework governs its review of the statute?

**Discussion:** The plaintiffs allege injury to their constitutional rights and seek relief within a traditional case or controversy. The court should therefore exercise judicial review, assess whether the plaintiffs have standing, and evaluate the statute under Fourth Amendment standards instead of dismissing it as a political question.

      prompt: 'Why did Chief Justice Marshall conclude in Marbury v. Madison that courts must disregard unconstitutional statutes?',
      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'Because the Constitution expressly commands courts to rewrite offending statutes.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'Because allowing unconstitutional laws to stand would negate the supremacy of the written Constitution.' },
        { id: 'c', label: 'Because Congress delegated that authority to the judiciary through the Judiciary Act of 1789.' },
        { id: 'd', label: 'Because the President requested advisory opinions on the statute.' }
      ],
      answer: 'b',
      explanation:
        'Marshall emphasized that written constitutions would be meaningless if legislatures could override them at will; judges must treat the Constitution as the supreme law and refuse to apply conflicting statutes.'
