The Supremacy Clause ensures that federal law made pursuant to the Constitution overrides conflicting state law. Preemption analysis typically begins with congressional intent. When Congress expressly states that federal law displaces state regulation, courts give effect to that directive, subject to the limits of Congress's constitutional authority.

In the absence of express language, courts infer implied preemption in two principal forms. Field preemption arises when federal regulation is so pervasive that it leaves no room for complementary state laws, as in alien registration or nuclear safety contexts. Conflict preemption occurs either when compliance with both state and federal law is impossible or when the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of federal objectives.

Judges apply a presumption against preemption in areas of traditional state concern, such as public health or safety. Nonetheless, strong evidence of congressional intent or an incompatibility with federal purposes can overcome that presumption. Courts often examine statutory structure, legislative history, and agency interpretations to determine whether preemption is warranted.

Practitioners should craft arguments that align with federalism principles and the Supremacy Clause's hierarchy. Supporters of preemption emphasize uniform national standards and statutory text, while opponents highlight state police powers and cooperative federalism. Understanding these considerations guides litigation strategy in fields ranging from environmental regulation to consumer protection.
