The Eleventh Amendment bars suits against states in federal court unless the state consents, Congress validly abrogates immunity, or the plaintiff seeks prospective relief against an appropriate officer. The protection extends to state agencies deemed arms of the state but not to municipalities or private contractors.

Congress may abrogate immunity when legislating under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and expressing an unmistakably clear intent. The statute must also be congruent and proportional to documented constitutional violations, as cases like *Seminole Tribe* and *Boerne* emphasize. States may waive immunity expressly or by removing certain cases to federal court, but waiver is never lightly inferred.

Imagine a public university employee alleging wage discrimination under a federal statute grounded in the Commerce Clause. The state moves to dismiss citing immunity. The plaintiff counters that Congress abrogated immunity under Section 5 because the law remedies gender discrimination with a tailored record of state violations, while also pleading an Ex parte Young claim for reinstatement against the university president.

Ex parte Young allows suits against state officials for ongoing violations of federal law seeking prospective relief, sidestepping the state's sovereign status. Litigants should carefully frame relief as forward-looking injunctions or declaratory orders and avoid retrospective damages or penalty requests that would trigger immunity concerns.
