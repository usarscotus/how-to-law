Constitutional provisions constrain government, so every claim starts by proving state action. Direct actions by state or local officials easily satisfy the requirement, and federal conduct implicates Fifth Amendment due process. Private conduct, however, escapes constitutional scrutiny unless it carries the imprimatur of the state.

Courts recognize limited circumstances where private parties are treated as state actors. The public function doctrine applies when a private entity performs a function traditionally and exclusively reserved to the state, such as running a company town. Entanglement and entwinement principles capture situations where the government significantly encourages, coerces, or is structurally intertwined with private conduct.

Consider a private homeowners' association that hires off-duty police to enforce its bylaws, and city officials attend board meetings to coordinate security. A resident expelled for political leafleting would argue state action based on joint participation and delegated policing authority, while the association insists it merely exercises private property rights.

When state action is shaky, litigants can pursue parallel statutory claims, sue individual officials under color of law, or press for discovery exposing governmental involvement. Defense counsel should emphasize the narrowness of public function and entwinement doctrines and develop factual records showing voluntary, non-compulsory private conduct.
