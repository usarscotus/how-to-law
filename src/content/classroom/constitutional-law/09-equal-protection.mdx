The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person the equal protection of the laws. Courts analyze challenged classifications using a tiered framework. Suspect classifications such as race and national origin trigger strict scrutiny, requiring the government to prove a compelling interest and narrow tailoring.

Quasi-suspect classifications, including gender and legitimacy, receive intermediate scrutiny, under which the government must show the law is substantially related to important objectives. *United States v. Virginia* emphasized that justifications for gender-based distinctions must be genuine and not rely on outdated stereotypes. By contrast, most economic and social welfare regulations receive rational basis review and are upheld if they bear a reasonable relation to legitimate governmental purposes.

Equal protection doctrine also addresses fundamental rights. When government action burdens the right to vote, travel, or access courts, strict scrutiny applies even if the classification is not facially suspect. Additionally, the Court has scrutinized discriminatory intent, holding in *Washington v. Davis* that disparate impact alone does not violate equal protection absent proof of purposeful discrimination.

Advocates must gather evidence of classification, intent, and impact while articulating the appropriate level of scrutiny. Persuasive briefing often juxtaposes precedent, historical context, and practical consequences to show why government action either perpetuates unjustified distinctions or fits within permissible regulatory discretion.
