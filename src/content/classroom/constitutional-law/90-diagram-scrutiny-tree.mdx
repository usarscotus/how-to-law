summary: "Trace the sequence for selecting the right level of constitutional scrutiny when challenging government action."
objectives:
  - "Differentiate between suspect, quasi-suspect, and non-suspect classifications."
  - "Match government burdens on fundamental rights to the correct scrutiny tier."
  - "Spot when rational basis review still has bite for animus-driven regulations."

When a statute or policy is challenged under the Equal Protection Clause, the first task is to identify the classification or right at stake. That determines whether strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or rational basis review governs the analysis, and whether the government bears the burden of justification.

Use this visual to map how courts move from state action to the choice of scrutiny and on to likely outcomes. Keep doctrines like fundamental rights, quasi-suspect classifications, and rational basis with bite in mind as you advise clients or craft arguments.
