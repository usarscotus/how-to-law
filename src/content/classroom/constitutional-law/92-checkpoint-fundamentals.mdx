Revisit how the Constitution allocates power across the branches and the states, and how the courts enforce those allocations. Reflect on the textual sources of federal power, the limits imposed by enumerated powers, and the ways judicial review polices those boundaries. Aim to distinguish political questions from justiciable controversies while appreciating the structural role of the judiciary.

Consider how federalism doctrines shape the relationship between national supremacy and state autonomy. Think through the reach of the Commerce Clause, the anti-commandeering principle, and the interplay between Section 5 enforcement and congruence and proportionality. Use hypotheticals to test your ability to spot structural issues before doctrinal nuance takes over.
