Federalism divides authority between a national government of enumerated powers and states that retain general police powers. Article I, Section 8 lists powers such as regulating commerce, taxing, and spending, while the Tenth Amendment reserves unassigned powers to the states or the people. This structure balances national cohesion with local experimentation.

The Supreme Court has enforced structural boundaries against federal overreach. In *New York v. United States* and *Printz v. United States*, the Court rejected laws that compelled states to enact regulations or conscripted state officers to implement federal programs. These anti-commandeering cases underscore that Congress must regulate individuals directly rather than commandeer state governments.

Conversely, states may not obstruct valid federal initiatives. The Supremacy Clause ensures that federal statutes made pursuant to the Constitution preempt conflicting state laws. When Congress legislates within its authority, states must yield, though they may supplement or provide greater protections unless preemption is express or implied.

Federalism also shapes remedies and litigation strategy. Plaintiffs challenging state action often pursue federal claims through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, while states sometimes invoke sovereign immunity defenses. Appreciating federalism's dual sovereignty helps advocates navigate jurisdiction, preemption, and constitutional limits on both levels of government.
