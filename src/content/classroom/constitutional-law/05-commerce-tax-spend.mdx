Congress may regulate channels of interstate commerce, instrumentalities and persons in interstate commerce, and activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Cases such as *Gibbons v. Ogden* and *Wickard v. Filburn* reflect broad authority, while decisions like *United States v. Lopez* and *NFIB v. Sebelius* remind courts that purely local, non-economic activity may fall outside congressional reach.

The Taxing Clause empowers Congress to levy taxes that raise revenue or influence conduct, provided the measures operate as genuine taxes rather than penalties. In *NFIB*, the Court sustained the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate as a tax, despite rejecting it under the Commerce Clause. The distinction turns on factors like revenue generation, absence of punitive intent, and the availability of alternatives.

The Spending Clause allows Congress to attach conditions to federal funds offered to states. Under *South Dakota v. Dole*, conditions must promote the general welfare, be unambiguous, relate to the federal interest in the program, and avoid violating other constitutional provisions. The coercion doctrine, highlighted in *NFIB*, bars funding threats so severe that states have no real choice but to comply.

Mastering these powers helps advocates evaluate federal regulatory schemes, assess whether conditions on grants cross the line into coercion, and anticipate challenges to legislation premised on broad interpretations of interstate commerce.
