    options:
      - "Rational basis"
      - "Intermediate scrutiny"

Judicial review ensures that every constitutional question begins with the courts’ willingness to measure legislative and executive acts against the nation’s charter. Remember that justiciability doctrines—standing, ripeness, and mootness—help channel disputes into the kind of concrete controversies the judiciary can resolve. When those thresholds are met, litigants must connect their arguments to text, history, structure, and precedent to persuade a court to exercise its reviewing power.

Federalism principles allocate power between the national government and the states. Enumerated powers authorize Congress to legislate in specific domains, while the Tenth Amendment reserves other powers to the states. Limits like the anti-commandeering doctrine and restrictions on state discrimination against interstate commerce preserve the balance. Spotting the relevant source of power or restraint is critical before you dive into the granular doctrines of commerce, spending, or preemption.

Individual rights analysis operates through tiers of scrutiny. Economic regulation ordinarily receives deferential rational basis review, while laws targeting suspect classifications or burdening fundamental rights face more searching scrutiny. Keep the tiers and their triggers in mind so you can quickly map any rights problem to the proper analytical framework.
