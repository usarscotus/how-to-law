Selective incorporation refers to the Supreme Court's process of applying most federal Bill of Rights protections to state and local governments via the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Rather than incorporating the first eight amendments wholesale, the Court has evaluated each right individually to determine whether it is fundamental to the American scheme of justice.

Beginning in the early twentieth century, cases like *Gitlow v. New York* and *Near v. Minnesota* extended freedom of speech and press to the states. The Court later incorporated rights such as the exclusionary rule (*Mapp v. Ohio*), counsel in felony cases (*Gideon v. Wainwright*), and the right to keep and bear arms (*McDonald v. Chicago*). Incorporation ensures uniform national standards for core liberties.

A handful of provisions remain unincorporated, including the Third Amendment, the Fifth Amendment's grand jury requirement, and the Seventh Amendment civil jury right. The Court has occasionally revisited incorporation questions, as in *Timbs v. Indiana*, which applied the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause to the states. These decisions rely on historical analysis and contemporary understanding of fundamental rights.

For litigators, incorporation arguments often arise when challenging state action in areas where precedent is unsettled or evolving. Advocates gather historical evidence, survey comparative practices, and emphasize the importance of uniform protection to persuade courts that a right is fundamental and should bind the states.
