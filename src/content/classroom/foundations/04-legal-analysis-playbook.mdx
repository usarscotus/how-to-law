## Start with the question presented

Whether you are counseling a client or drafting a memo, begin by restating the question presented in neutral language. Identify the tribunal, the procedural posture, and the relief sought. Precision on the question disciplines the rest of the analysis.

<Callout kind="info" title="Checklist for framing the issue">
  - Who is asking for relief, and against whom?
  - Which court or agency will decide the dispute?
  - What legal authority is likely to control (statute, regulation, precedent)?
</Callout>

## Break the problem into elements

Every rule can be decomposed into elements. Write them out explicitly. For example, a claim for negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages. A constitutional challenge may require state action, a right, and a level of scrutiny. Turning narrative facts into element-by-element questions keeps your analysis organized.

Use verbs that match the standard of proof or review—"demonstrates," "substantially burdens," or "knowingly caused." That language reminds you what the decision maker must find before ruling.

## Gather the governing rules

Once the issue is clear, collect the binding sources in order of authority. Constitutions outrank statutes, statutes outrank regulations, and all outrank persuasive commentary. For each element, note the controlling case or provision and the key passage that articulates the rule.

If there is a split of authority, summarize the competing rules and identify which line of precedent your tribunal will likely adopt. A trial court is bound by its appellate court, while the Supreme Court can resolve conflicts among circuits.

## Apply facts with a theory of the case

Do not merely restate facts—explain why they satisfy or fail an element. Tie each fact to the rule language and emphasize policy considerations that support your conclusion. Where the record is thin, flag the factual gaps and suggest discovery or investigation steps.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Theory of the case">
  A persuasive analysis features a narrative that makes doctrinal sense. Decide early whether your theme is fairness, institutional role, or statutory text, and let that theme guide which facts you spotlight.
</Callout>

## Conclude and recommend action

A conclusion should tell the client or supervisor what to do next. If the law is unsettled, describe the risk, outline fallback arguments, and identify procedural moves—such as seeking oral argument or pursuing settlement—that align with your assessment.

      prompt: 'Why is it helpful to rewrite a rule into distinct elements before analyzing facts?',
      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'It allows you to cite persuasive authority instead of binding law.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'It ensures you examine each required component of the rule against the available facts.' },

      ],
      answer: 'b',
      explanation:
        'Breaking a rule into elements creates a checklist so you can match facts to each requirement and avoid overlooking a necessary component of the claim or defense.'
