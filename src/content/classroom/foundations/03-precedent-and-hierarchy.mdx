Precedent is the backbone of the common law tradition. When a court resolves a dispute and publishes an opinion, that decision becomes part of the body of case law that guides future judges. The doctrine of stare decisis instructs courts to follow their own prior decisions and those of higher courts within the same judicial hierarchy.

Vertical stare decisis is the most rigid form. A trial court must follow controlling decisions from its appellate court and the Supreme Court. For example, a federal district court in California is bound by Ninth Circuit precedent on federal issues, even if a different circuit has reached a conflicting result. The same structure applies in state systems: trial courts follow state intermediate appellate courts and the state supreme court.

Horizontal stare decisis concerns how a court treats its own prior decisions. The Supreme Court adheres to its past holdings absent a special justification, but it may overrule precedent when legal or factual circumstances change. Intermediate appellate courts typically follow their own earlier panels unless an en banc court revisits the question.

Not every decision binds. Opinions from courts outside the governing hierarchy—such as a sister state supreme court or a federal circuit outside the forum—serve as persuasive authority. Lawyers cite them to show how respected tribunals interpret similar statutes or constitutional provisions, but the court is free to disagree. Likewise, dicta in a controlling case may illuminate a principle without conclusively resolving the dispute.

Effective legal analysis begins by mapping the hierarchy. Identify the tribunal, list the sources that bind it, and determine whether contrary authority exists. When precedent points in different directions, litigators explain why one line better fits the facts, the statutory text, or the underlying policy goals. Understanding those relationships allows advocates to predict outcomes and craft arguments that respect the structure of the judiciary.
