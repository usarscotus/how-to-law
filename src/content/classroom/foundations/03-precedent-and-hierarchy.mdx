## Binding versus persuasive authority

Binding precedent compels a court to follow a rule announced by a higher tribunal in the same jurisdiction. For example, a District Court must apply holdings from its Court of Appeals and from the Supreme Court. Decisions from other circuits or state courts may be persuasive but are not binding.

Persuasive authority includes treatises, law review articles, and decisions from other jurisdictions. Courts often consult persuasive sources to understand how similar issues were handled elsewhere, especially when binding precedent is sparse or ambiguous.

## Vertical hierarchy in the federal courts

The federal judicial system has three primary tiers: District Courts, Courts of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. District Courts handle trials and make findings of fact. Courts of Appeals review District Court decisions for legal error. The Supreme Court provides final appellate review on matters of federal law.

A panel decision of a Court of Appeals binds subsequent panels unless overruled by the court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court. Likewise, District Courts within the circuit must follow that appellate precedent.

## Overruling and distinguishing precedent

A court may distinguish precedent by demonstrating that a material factual or legal difference makes the earlier rule inapplicable. Overruling occurs when the controlling court concludes that a precedent is unworkable, inconsistent with other doctrine, or unsupported by changed circumstances. The Supreme Court in *Casey* listed factors for overruling, including reliance interests and the quality of reasoning.

  Before urging a court to abandon precedent, evaluate whether parties have structured conduct around the existing rule. Significant reliance weighs against overruling.

## Building a precedent table

Constructing a precedent table helps teams analyze controlling authorities. List relevant decisions, the issuing court, the holding, and whether the case supports or undermines your position. Update the table as new decisions emerge.
