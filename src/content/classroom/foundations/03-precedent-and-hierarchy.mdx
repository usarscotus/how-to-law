Hierarchy keeps the common law coherent. Vertical <Term client:load id="stare-decisis" /> means lower courts follow higher ones. Horizontal stare decisis means a court tries to follow its own precedent unless it has a strong reason to change course.

### Binding versus persuasive

Binding authority includes decisions from higher courts in the same jurisdiction. Persuasive authority covers everything else: sibling circuits, state courts, academic commentary. Judges cite persuasive sources to signal reasonableness or to tee up a doctrinal shift.

### RP narrative twist

When you introduce a precedent-breaking faction, show the ripple effects: litigants rush to file in the new friendly forum, while opponents scramble for emergency relief in a different venue. That tension makes the world feel dynamic.

### Spotlight the hierarchy visually

A quick diagram can help players grasp who outranks whom.

```
US Supreme Court
  ↓
Circuit Courts of Appeals
  ↓
District Courts
  ↓
Agencies & Tribunals
```

In RP, you might swap in special tribunals or councils. Just keep the arrows clear so your cast knows who can overrule whom.
