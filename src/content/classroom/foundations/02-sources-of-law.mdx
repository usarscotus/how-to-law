    prompt: Which source of law controls when a federal statute conflicts with a state ordinance on the same subject?
    options:
      - The ordinance controls because it is more specific.
      - The federal statute controls because the Supremacy Clause gives enacted federal law priority.
      - Neither source controls until the Supreme Court resolves the dispute.
      - Both sources apply and the party may choose the more favorable rule.
    answer: The federal statute controls because the Supremacy Clause gives enacted federal law priority.
    explanation: Valid federal statutes enacted within Congress's authority supersede conflicting state or local law under the Supremacy Clause.

The United States legal system rests on a hierarchy of sources. At the top sit constitutions—most importantly, the U.S. Constitution and each state's charter. A constitution allocates power, sets structural rules, and protects rights. When a statute conflicts with constitutional text, judges must follow the supreme law of the land.

Below constitutions are statutes. Congress and state legislatures enact statutes through formal procedures that require bicameral passage and executive signature (or a veto override). Statutes state general rules that bind courts and agencies. For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination, and state motor vehicle codes set licensing requirements.

Statutes often delegate details to administrative agencies. Agencies adopt regulations that carry the force of law so long as they remain within the bounds of the statute and the agency's jurisdiction. The Environmental Protection Agency issues emissions standards; the Social Security Administration defines eligibility criteria. Regulations must follow the Administrative Procedure Act's notice-and-comment process unless an exception applies.

Judicial opinions interpret all of these materials. Courts resolve disputes, construe statutes and regulations, and develop common law doctrines where legislatures are silent. When an appellate court issues precedent, lower courts within the same hierarchy must follow it. That is why a trial court in the Second Circuit cannot disregard a controlling Supreme Court interpretation of a federal statute.

Local governments contribute a fourth layer. Municipal councils enact ordinances on zoning, noise, and public safety. These ordinances operate only within the city's boundaries and must remain consistent with state enabling statutes and constitutional limits on police power.

Conflicts arise when sources collide. The Supremacy Clause makes valid federal law superior to state law. Within a single system, the doctrine of preemption ensures that a federal statute can displace contrary state rules, while state constitutions constrain local ordinances. Jurisdiction also matters: a court cannot enforce a regulation issued by an agency that lacks statutory authority, and a city cannot legislate beyond its borders.

When analyzing a problem, start with the question presented: what tribunal is deciding the case, and what sources bind that tribunal? If a plaintiff challenges a state ordinance in federal district court, the judge will examine the U.S. Constitution, the relevant federal statute, and any on-point precedent. State law may fill gaps, but it cannot override controlling federal authority.
