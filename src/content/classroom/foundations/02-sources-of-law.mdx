In the US system, constitutions sit at the top. The federal Constitution binds everyone, while state constitutions control within their borders unless the <Term client:load id="supremacy-clause" /> steps in. Statutes fill in details, regulations operationalize, and cases interpret.

### Constitutional authority

Each government actor is limited by the text and structure of its constitution. Congress needs an enumerated power—often the <Term client:load id="commerce-clause" />—before legislating. States keep broad <Term client:load id="police-power" />s unless preempted.

### Statutes and regulations

Agencies don't legislate from scratch. They implement statutes, and courts review whether a rule stays within delegated authority. When agencies speak with the force of law, regulated parties must comply or face enforcement.

  In RP, it's easy to stack federal, state, and faction rules. If your RP world adds a magical council with override powers, note which level takes priority when conflicts arise.

### RP override spotlight

<Callout
  client:load
  kind="rp"
  baseline="Federal law is supreme within its enumerated scope; states retain police powers."
  rule="RP campaigns may let city charters outrank federal statutes to highlight local factions."
/>

Even with this twist, try to keep a logic chain: if a city charter beats Congress, explain why the Supreme Court tolerates it. Maybe a treaty or ancient pact provides the carve-out. Those breadcrumbs help players follow cause and effect.
