## Constitutional supremacy

The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Article VI, the Supremacy Clause, binds judges in every state to follow federal law whenever it conflicts with a state enactment. Constitutional provisions require amendment to change. Courts use text, history, structure, and precedent to interpret constitutional meaning.

<Callout kind="note" title="Judicial review">
  Judicial review allows courts to invalidate statutes or executive actions that conflict with the Constitution. It also requires courts to respect political branch choices when the Constitution commits decisions to those branches.

## Statutes and regulations

Congress enacts statutes that create rights, duties, and programs. Because modern governance demands technical detail, Congress often delegates implementation to administrative agencies. An agency proposes a rule, receives public comment, and publishes a final regulation in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations carry the force of law if they are within the scope of the delegation and follow required procedure.

Agencies may also issue adjudicatory decisions or policy guidance, but only properly promulgated regulations bind the public. Courts reviewing an agency action examine statutory authority, procedure, and reasonableness.

## Judicial decisions and precedent

When a court decides a case, its opinion resolves the dispute and articulates the governing rule. The binding portion of an opinion is the holding: the rule necessary to decide the outcome on the facts presented. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, a lower court must follow controlling precedent from higher courts in its jurisdiction.

Appellate courts may distinguish earlier decisions if the facts or legal issues materially differ. They may also overrule precedent when special justification exists, considering factors such as workability, reliance, and doctrinal coherence.

## Putting the hierarchy together

The hierarchy of authority typically runs Constitution → statute → regulation → judicial decision applying those sources. When authorities conflict, apply the higher source. When multiple authorities are valid and consistent, harmonize them to give effect to all.

      choices: [
        { id: 'a', label: 'The regulation controls because agencies may fill statutory gaps however they choose.' },
        { id: 'b', label: 'The statute prevails because regulations must be consistent with statutory authority.' },

      ],
      answer: 'b',
      explanation:
        'Regulations derive their force from the statute that authorizes them. A regulation that conflicts with the statute is invalid and cannot be enforced.'
