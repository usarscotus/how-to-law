## Law as an authoritative system

In the United States, law is a body of enforceable commands issued or recognized by legitimate public institutions. Those commands take written form—such as a statute, regulation, or constitutional provision—or they emerge through judicial decisions applying precedent. Law differs from etiquette or custom because it is backed by the coercive power of the state. Courts can enter a judgment, the executive can execute it, and private actors must comply.

The Supreme Court in *Marbury v. Madison* emphasized that the Constitution is paramount law. Any conflicting act must yield, and it is the role of the judiciary to say what the law is. That judicial duty links the judicial branch to the legislative and executive branches in a system of separated powers.

## Functions of law

Legal rules perform several core functions:

- **Order and security.** Criminal and civil rules protect persons and property.
- **Dispute resolution.** Courts provide a forum for resolving conflicts through structured process.
- **Guidance and planning.** Predictable rules allow individuals and businesses to plan conduct and allocate risk.
- **Legitimacy.** When government adheres to published rules, it promotes the rule of law rather than rule by discretion.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Focus on institutional sources">
  When analyzing a problem, ask which institution supplied the governing rule—Congress, an agency, a court, or the Constitution itself. The answer determines hierarchy, interpretive method, and available remedies.

## Institutions that create law

1. **Legislatures** enact statutes that establish prospective rules of general applicability.
2. **Administrative agencies** adopt regulations and adjudicate disputes within delegated authority.
3. **Courts** issue opinions that resolve specific controversies and, through precedent, articulate generally applicable principles.
4. **Executive officials** implement and enforce the law through prosecution, investigation, and administration.

These institutions operate under constitutional constraints, including due process and separation of powers. Understanding which branch produced the governing rule determines how that rule can change and which tribunal can review it.

## Legitimacy and predictability

The American system depends on transparent procedures, notice, and reasoned decision-making. Courts publish opinions explaining their holdings, agencies must follow the Administrative Procedure Act when issuing substantive rules, and legislatures enact laws through bicameralism and presentment. These procedures give citizens notice and allow them to contest government action.
