US law is built on layers. Legislatures pass <Term client:load id="statute" />s, agencies craft <Term client:load id="regulation" />, and courts publish opinions. Together they make up the "sources of law" that bind public actors and private parties alike.

## The hierarchy that keeps order

Consider the relationship between Congress, agencies, and courts. Congress writes statutes that delegate authority. Agencies like the Department of Justice create regulations within that statutory box. Courts interpret both statutes and regulations, producing case law. The doctrine of <Term client:load id="stare-decisis" /> keeps decisions consistent: lower courts must follow higher courts when facts align.

  Think about which institution has narrative control. If your story hinges on an agency rule, remember that Congress can override it—and so can your RP storytellers.

## RP divergence: Appeals as a fast lane

  baseline="Appeals typically go District → Circuit → Supreme Court with discretionary review."
  rule="RP worlds allow direct petitions from District to Supreme Court, skipping circuits for dramatic pacing."
/>

This divergence fuels drama but changes leverage. In US courts, litigants rely on intermediate appellate rulings to build doctrine. In RP, parties may jump straight to the top, so precedent develops through marquee cases.

## Why precedent still matters

Even in RP, courts cite earlier decisions for legitimacy. A Supreme Court analog in your world likely references controlling authority to show continuity. That keeps the RP universe grounded in recognizable legal process.

Look for cues in your narrative to show when characters invoke precedent: naming the case, citing the holding, or hinting at dissent. Those touches make the RP universe feel real.
