A court cannot adjudicate a dispute unless it has subject-matter jurisdiction. Federal district courts are tribunals of limited jurisdiction: Article III and statutes like 28 U.S.C. § 1331 authorize them to hear federal question cases, diversity suits exceeding the amount-in-controversy threshold, and certain specialized matters. If jurisdiction is absent, the court must dismiss at any time, even if the parties wish to proceed.

Personal jurisdiction addresses the court’s authority over particular defendants. Federal courts typically borrow the personal jurisdiction rules of the state in which they sit, subject to due process limits. A state’s long-arm statute identifies the contacts—such as transacting business, committing a tort, or owning property—that allow courts to exercise power over nonresidents.

Due process requires that exercising jurisdiction comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Defendants with continuous and systematic contacts may be subject to general jurisdiction, permitting suit on any claim. More commonly, litigants rely on specific jurisdiction: the plaintiff must show that the dispute arises out of or relates to the defendant’s purposeful forum contacts and that asserting jurisdiction is reasonable.

Strategic litigators evaluate both forms of jurisdiction at the outset. A defendant who lacks minimum contacts should timely object, or risk consenting by appearing without raising the issue. Conversely, subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived; even a final judgment may be vacated if the court lacked power to hear the case.
