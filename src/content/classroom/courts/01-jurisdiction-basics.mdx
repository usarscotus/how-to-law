## Subject-matter jurisdiction

Subject-matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear a particular type of dispute. Federal courts have limited jurisdiction: they may hear cases arising under federal law, controversies between citizens of different states exceeding the statutory amount in controversy, and certain specialized matters. Because subject-matter jurisdiction stems from Article III and federal statutes, parties cannot create it by agreement. A court lacking subject-matter jurisdiction must dismiss the case at any stage.

<Callout kind="note" title="Checking federal question jurisdiction">
  A case arises under federal law when the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint establishes a right to relief under federal statutes or the Constitution. Anticipated defenses do not create jurisdiction.

## Personal jurisdiction

Personal jurisdiction concerns a court's authority to bind specific defendants. In federal court, personal jurisdiction usually tracks the law of the state where the District Court sits, subject to constitutional due process limits. States use long-arm statutes to reach defendants who have certain connections with the forum.

The Due Process Clause requires that a defendant have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum such that exercising jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Contacts may support **general jurisdiction**, allowing suits on any claim, or **specific jurisdiction**, tied to the defendant's forum-related conduct.

Courts evaluate purposeful availment, foreseeability, and fairness factors when assessing specific jurisdiction. A defendant may consent to personal jurisdiction by appearing and not objecting, but subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived.
