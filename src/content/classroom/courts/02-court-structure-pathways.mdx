## Trial to appellate courts

State and federal systems both rely on a hierarchy. Trial courts make factual findings and apply law in the first instance. Intermediate appellate courts review for legal error, while supreme courts provide final authoritative pronouncements within the system.

| Level | Federal Courts | Typical State Courts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Court of last resort | U.S. Supreme Court | State Supreme Court |
| Intermediate appellate | Circuit Courts of Appeals | Intermediate Appeals Court |
| Trial | District Courts | Superior or Circuit Court |

Appeals generally lie as of right from trial courts to intermediate appellate courts, but further review is often discretionary. Understanding the hierarchy helps you frame arguments that respect precedent.

## Standards of review

Appellate courts apply different standards of review that shape advocacy:

- **De novo** for pure legal questions.
- **Clear error** for factual findings by judges.
- **Abuse of discretion** for evidentiary and procedural rulings.

Knowing the standard guides how much deference the appellate court will show the trial judge and how to craft persuasive points.

## Supreme Court review

The Supreme Court generally reviews cases through a writ of certiorari. A party must show that the case involves an important federal question, a split among courts, or a pressing need for guidance. Certain cases, such as those involving three-judge district courts issuing statewide injunctions, may be appealed as of right.
