Erie requires federal courts sitting in diversity to apply state substantive law and federal procedural law. The analysis begins by asking whether a valid federal statute or Rule on point conflicts with state law; if so, the federal provision controls so long as it is within the Rules Enabling Act and constitutional.

Absent a direct federal directive, courts assess whether ignoring state law would encourage forum shopping or produce inequitable administration of the lawsâ€”the twin aims of *Erie*. Outcome determinativeness is evaluated in a practical, case-specific way. Courts also consider whether the disputed issue is bound up with state-created rights and obligations.

Suppose a plaintiff sues in federal court invoking diversity, and the defendant moves to apply a state notice-of-claim requirement before suing municipalities. The Federal Rules lack an equivalent step. The plaintiff argues the requirement is procedural and conflicts with Rule 8's pleading standards; the city contends the notice statute is substantive because it conditions the right to sue.

Counsel should develop records showing the real-world consequences of applying or ignoring the state rule, including empirical evidence of forum shopping. When federal practice is a judge-made custom rather than a formal rule, courts weigh comity interests, ensuring the outcome in federal court mirrors state-court expectations when rights arise under state law.
