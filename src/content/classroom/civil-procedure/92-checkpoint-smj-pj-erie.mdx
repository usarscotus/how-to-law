Check your command over federal subject matter jurisdiction by tracing paths through federal question and diversity analysis. Make sure you can articulate the complete citizenship tests, aggregation rules, and supplemental jurisdiction limits, especially the Section 1367(b) carveouts that trip up removal.

Revisit the evolution of personal jurisdiction from Pennoyer to International Shoe and its modern progeny. Evaluate purposeful availment, fairness factors, and consent-based jurisdiction, and then walk through the Erie twin aims to decide when federal courts must apply state substantive law. Confirm you can run this decision tree quickly before the clock starts on an exam.
