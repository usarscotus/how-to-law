## Filing and responsive pleadings

A civil action begins with a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief. Service of process provides notice to defendants, who must respond with an answer or motion under Rule 12. Motions to dismiss test jurisdiction, venue, and the sufficiency of the pleading.

## Discovery and case management

Once the pleadings close, parties enter discovery. They exchange initial disclosures, interrogatories, document requests, and depositions. Judges use Rule 16 conferences to manage the schedule and encourage settlement.

Discovery shapes the summary judgment record. Parties may move under Rule 56 when there is no genuine dispute of material fact, citing **Celotex** to show the absence of evidence on an essential element.

If a case reaches trial, parties present evidence to a judge or jury. After verdict, parties can move for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial. Final judgments are appealable, while interlocutory orders are usually not.
