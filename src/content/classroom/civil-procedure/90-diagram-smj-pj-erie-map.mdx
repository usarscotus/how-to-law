Federal civil procedure questions often jumble jurisdiction and Erie together. Keeping them straight requires a quick reference for the statutory hooks, constitutional limits, and choice-of-law consequences that flow from each doctrine.

The matrix lines up the core questions, tests, and remedies for subject-matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, and Erie so you can identify what must be raised, when, and how courts resolve conflicts between state and federal authority.
