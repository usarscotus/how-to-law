Claim preclusion bars parties from relitigating the same claim once a final judgment on the merits is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The rule requires the same parties or their privies and a common nucleus of operative facts; many jurisdictions follow the transactional test to define the scope of a claim.

Issue preclusion prevents relitigation of an issue actually litigated, determined, and essential to the judgment in a prior action. The party against whom estoppel is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate. Non-mutual defensive issue preclusion is widely accepted, while offensive use depends on fairness factors articulated in *Parklane Hosiery*.

Imagine a plaintiff who loses a federal diversity suit alleging design defect, with the jury finding the product reasonably safe. The plaintiff then sues the same manufacturer in state court alleging negligent failure to warn based on the same accident. The manufacturer argues claim preclusion, or at minimum issue preclusion on product safety.

Courts consider whether jurisdictional limits or procedural differences justify refusing preclusion, such as when the prior court lacked authority to award certain relief. Parties should raise preclusion defenses promptly and provide certified records of the prior judgment to meet their burden.
