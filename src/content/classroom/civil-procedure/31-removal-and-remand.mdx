Removal allows defendants to shift cases from state to federal court when federal jurisdiction exists. All properly joined and served defendants must consent, and removal generally must occur within 30 days of receiving the initial pleading or other paper revealing removability. Diversity cases face an additional one-year cap unless the plaintiff acted in bad faith.

The forum-defendant rule bars removal in diversity cases when any properly joined and served defendant is a citizen of the forum state. Snap removal exploits unserved defendants to bypass the rule, but some courts reject the tactic as inconsistent with statutory purpose. After filing the notice of removal, defendants must promptly notify adverse parties and the state court to halt state proceedings.

Imagine a product liability suit filed in state court against an out-of-state manufacturer and an in-state retailer. The manufacturer removes the case before the retailer is served, citing diversity and snap removal. The plaintiff moves to remand, arguing the removal was premature and that the retailer destroys complete diversity.

Remand motions raising procedural defects must be filed within 30 days, whereas subject-matter jurisdiction objections may be raised at any time. If remand is granted, the federal court may award costs and fees if the removal lacked an objectively reasonable basis. Defendants should document their jurisdictional analysis to defend against fee requests.
