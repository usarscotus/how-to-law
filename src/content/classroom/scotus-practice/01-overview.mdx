## Jurisdiction and docket control

The Supreme Court exercises appellate jurisdiction over cases arising from federal courts and state courts that decide federal questions. Most cases arrive by petition for a writ of certiorari, which the Court grants only when important federal questions or conflicts among lower courts warrant review. The Court also retains limited original jurisdiction over disputes between states.

Rule 10 explains the considerations for granting certiorari. The Court is more likely to grant review when lower courts disagree on a question of federal law, when a lower court has decided an important question in a way that conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, or when a federal court has departed markedly from accepted judicial procedures.

## Petition practice

The party seeking review files a petition for a writ of certiorari within 90 days of the judgment below. The petition should succinctly identify the question presented, relevant facts, procedural history, and reasons for granting the writ. The opposing party may file a brief in opposition. Four votes—the Rule of Four—are required to grant certiorari.

<Callout kind="tip" title="Strategic screening">
  Experienced advocates consult the Court’s docket and cert statistics to gauge the likelihood of review. Narrowing the question presented to one or two issues increases the chance that the Justices will view the case as a suitable vehicle.

## Merits briefing and argument

If the Court grants certiorari, the case proceeds to merits briefing. The petitioner files the opening brief, followed by the respondent’s brief and any reply. Amicus curiae submissions can provide additional perspectives but must comply with Rule 37. Briefs should focus on the governing precedent, policy implications, and institutional concerns.

Oral argument typically occurs several months after briefing. Advocates should be prepared to answer questions on doctrinal nuance, practical consequences, and the appropriate standard of review. Following argument, the Justices conference and assign an opinion author.
