## Structural injunctions

Structural remedies reshape institutional practices, often in public law contexts such as school desegregation, prison conditions, and public housing. Courts issue broad orders requiring policy changes, staffing adjustments, or facility upgrades. *Brown II* directed local authorities to desegregate schools “with all deliberate speed,” exemplifying judicial oversight of institutional reform.

## Compliance mechanisms

Courts may appoint **special masters**, monitors, or receivers to oversee implementation. Orders can mandate periodic reporting, benchmarks, and timelines. Contempt powers ensure compliance, but courts strive for cooperative solutions with governmental entities.

Consent decrees blend contract and judicial order. They allow negotiated solutions with enforceable obligations. Parties must understand that modification requires court approval.

## Limits on judicial management

Separation-of-powers concerns caution against micromanaging public institutions. The Prison Litigation Reform Act imposes limits on federal court relief in prison cases, requiring findings that relief is narrowly drawn, necessary, and the least intrusive means.

**Rufo** established a flexible standard for modifying institutional reform consent decrees. A party seeking modification must show a significant change in factual conditions or law, and the proposed modification must be suitably tailored. Courts balance the need for continued oversight with respect for state and local governance.

## Strategy for litigants

Plaintiffs must build robust factual records documenting systemic violations and propose workable remedies. Defendants should develop compliance plans and seek early termination when durable remedies are achieved. Both sides should engage stakeholders—community groups, experts, and administrators—to craft sustainable reforms.
