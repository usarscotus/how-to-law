## Laches and delay

Laches bars equitable relief when a plaintiff unreasonably delays in asserting a claim and the delay prejudices the defendant. Unlike statutes of limitations, laches is flexible and considers the plaintiff’s knowledge, excuses for delay, and resulting evidentiary or economic prejudice. *Petrella* cautions that laches cannot truncate legal claims within a federal limitations period, but equitable relief like injunctions may still be curtailed.

## Unclean hands and misconduct

The unclean hands doctrine denies relief to plaintiffs who engaged in inequitable conduct related to the subject matter of the suit. The misconduct must have an immediate and necessary relation to the equity sought. Courts may refuse injunctions or specific performance if the plaintiff acted fraudulently, violated the law, or breached fiduciary duties.

## Waiver and estoppel

**Waiver** arises when a party intentionally relinquishes a known right, often inferred from conduct. **Equitable estoppel** prevents a party from asserting a right when their misleading statements induced reliance and prejudice. Promissory estoppel can likewise limit equitable relief if enforcing the promise would be unjust.

## Undue hardship and balancing

Even if formal defenses fail, courts balance equities. An injunction that imposes disproportionate hardship relative to the benefit may be denied or modified. Courts may condition relief on payment of compensation or limit its scope to avoid oppressive results.

## Litigation strategy

Raise equitable defenses early in pleadings and motions to frame the dispute. Gather evidence of delay, prejudice, misconduct, or reliance. In settlement talks, highlight risks that equity may refuse relief, incentivizing compromise or monetary solutions instead.
