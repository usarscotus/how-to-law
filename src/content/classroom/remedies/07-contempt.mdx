## Civil versus criminal contempt

Contempt enforces court orders and upholds authority. **Civil contempt** seeks compliance or compensates parties for losses. Sanctions are coercive or remedial, such as fines conditional on compliance or per diem imprisonment that ceases when the contemnor obeys. **Criminal contempt** punishes past disobedience and vindicates court authority; sanctions are determinate fines or jail terms.

Direct contempt occurs in the courtroom and may be punished summarily to maintain order. Indirect contempt happens outside the court’s presence and requires notice and a hearing.

## Procedural protections

Civil contempt proceedings must provide notice of the alleged violation and an opportunity to purge by complying. Courts must find a clear and unambiguous order, violation, and ability to comply. Inability to comply is a defense, but contemnors must show they made reasonable efforts.

Criminal contempt requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt and, for serious penalties exceeding six months of imprisonment, a jury trial. *Bagwell* held that large punitive fines necessitate criminal procedural protections even if labeled civil.

## Sanctions and enforcement

Courts can impose coercive fines, compensatory awards, or imprisonment. They may also appoint receivers or use Rule 70 to authorize third parties to perform acts at the contemnor’s expense. Contempt sanctions are subject to appellate review for abuse of discretion.

## Strategic considerations

When seeking contempt, document the order, provide detailed affidavits of violation, and specify the relief requested. Consider whether alternative enforcement mechanisms—like writs of execution or garnishment—would suffice. Defendants should promptly move to clarify ambiguous orders to avoid inadvertent violations.
