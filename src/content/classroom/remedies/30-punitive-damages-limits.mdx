Punitive damages punish and deter egregious misconduct but must comport with due process. The Supreme Court's guideposts—degree of reprehensibility, ratio to compensatory damages, and comparison to statutory penalties—govern excessiveness review. Conduct involving repeated actions, reckless indifference to health and safety, or intentional harm ranks high on the reprehensibility scale.

Ratios exceeding single digits draw skepticism, though the Court has avoided rigid caps. Lower compensatory awards may justify higher ratios when harm is difficult to detect, while substantial compensatory damages often limit punitive awards to a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio. Courts also assess whether the punitive award mirrors available civil or criminal sanctions.

Imagine a jury awarding $200,000 in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages against a manufacturer for concealing a product defect. On appeal, the manufacturer argues the 25:1 ratio and lack of comparable penalties render the award unconstitutional. The plaintiff emphasizes deliberate deception and nationwide risk to consumers.

Trial lawyers should assemble evidence of reprehensibility—internal emails, prior incidents, regulatory findings—to sustain punitive awards. Defendants should seek bifurcation, request jury instructions on proportionality, and build records comparing punitive awards with statutory fines to support remittitur.
