## Legal versus equitable relief

Legal remedies typically involve monetary damages, while equitable remedies provide nonmonetary relief such as injunctions or specific performance. The Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a jury for legal claims but not equitable ones.

## Damages categories

Compensatory damages aim to make the plaintiff whole by restoring the position they would have occupied absent the wrongdoing. Consequential damages cover additional losses that were reasonably foreseeable. Punitive damages punish and deter egregious misconduct but require due process constraints.

Courts may also award **restitution** to prevent unjust enrichment, measured by the defendant’s gains rather than the plaintiff’s loss.

## Injunctions and equitable factors

Courts balance four factors before issuing a permanent injunction under *eBay*:

1. Irreparable injury.
2. Inadequacy of monetary relief.
3. Balance of hardships favoring the movant.
4. Public interest not disserved.
