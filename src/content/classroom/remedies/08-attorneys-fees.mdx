## The American Rule and exceptions

Under the American Rule, each party typically bears its own attorney’s fees. Exceptions arise by contract, statute, or equity. Fee-shifting statutes—common in civil rights, consumer protection, and environmental laws—authorize prevailing parties to recover reasonable fees. Contractual provisions may be unilateral or reciprocal; some jurisdictions automatically construe unilateral clauses as reciprocal.

## Lodestar methodology

Courts calculate statutory fees using the lodestar: reasonable hours multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. Documentation through contemporaneous time records is essential. Courts adjust the lodestar for limited success, duplication, or lack of billing judgment. Enhancements are rare but may reward exceptional results or delay in payment.

*Hensley* instructs courts to exclude hours not reasonably expended and to consider the degree of success. Partial success may warrant reductions if unsuccessful claims are unrelated.

## Equitable fee awards

*Alyeska* reaffirmed that federal courts cannot create new equitable fee-shifting doctrines absent statute, but traditional exceptions remain. The **common fund doctrine** allows courts to award fees from a fund created for the benefit of a class. The **common benefit doctrine** applies in shareholder suits and other representative actions. Courts may also award fees for bad-faith litigation conduct or when a party willfully disobeys court orders.

## Practical considerations

When seeking fees, file timely motions under Rule 54(d)(2), support them with affidavits, billing records, and evidence of prevailing market rates. Anticipate challenges to reasonableness, duplication, and proportionality. Conversely, parties opposing fees should highlight limited success, excessive rates, or inadequate documentation.
