Pause to check your grasp of the equitable balancing required for injunctive relief. Recall the need for irreparable harm, inadequate legal remedies, balance of hardships, and the public interest, and consider how these factors shift between temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent relief.

Evaluate how courts treat mandatory injunctions with heightened scrutiny and the role of structural orders in public law cases. Cross-reference defenses like laches, unclean hands, and mootness, making sure you can anticipate equitable discretion hurdles before recommending injunctive strategies.
