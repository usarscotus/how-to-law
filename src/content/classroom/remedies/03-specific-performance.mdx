## Threshold requirements

Specific performance is an equitable remedy compelling a party to perform contractual duties. Courts typically grant it when legal remedies are inadequate—because the goods or property are unique, damages are speculative, or the defendant is insolvent.

Real estate is presumptively unique, supporting specific performance for land-sale contracts. In goods transactions, the U.C.C. allows specific performance for unique goods or in other proper circumstances, such as output requirements and custom-made items.

## Clean hands and feasibility

Equitable relief requires the plaintiff to have performed or be ready to perform their obligations. A party in material breach cannot obtain specific performance. Courts also examine feasibility: they avoid supervising long-term personal-service obligations or orders that require constant judicial oversight.

**Mutuality of remedy** no longer demands that both parties could obtain specific performance, but courts may withhold relief if enforcement would impose undue hardship on the defendant or third parties.

## Defenses

Defendants can raise laches, unclean hands, impossibility, impracticability, or frustration. Equity is reluctant to force performance when circumstances changed drastically or enforcement would be oppressive. Contracts requiring continuous personal services are generally not specifically enforced, though negative covenants may be enforced to prevent competition.

## Drafting considerations

When seeking specific performance, plead with precision: describe the contract terms, demonstrate readiness to perform, and attach documentary evidence. Courts may condition relief on the plaintiff tendering consideration or complying with equitable terms to ensure fairness.
