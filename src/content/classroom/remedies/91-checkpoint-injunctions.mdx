    prompt: "Which factor is NOT part of the traditional four-factor test for injunctions?"
    options:
      - "Likelihood of success on the merits"
      - "Irreparable harm"
      - "Adequacy of monetary damages"

    answer: "Jury unanimity"
    explanation: "The equitable test weighs success likelihood, irreparable harm, balance of equities, and the public interest—not jury votes."
  - id: checkpoint-injunction-mandatory
    prompt: "True or False: Mandatory injunctions compel affirmative action and typically require a stronger showing than prohibitory orders."
    options:
      - "True"
      - "False"
    answer: "True"
    explanation: "Courts exercise special caution before ordering defendants to act, demanding clear entitlement and precise tailoring."
  - id: checkpoint-injunction-specificity
    prompt: "Rule 65(d) primarily requires injunctions to be:"
    options:
      - "Limited to monetary relief."
      - "Specific in terms, describing in reasonable detail the acts restrained or required."
      - "Approved by a jury before issuance."
      - "Automatically nationwide in scope."
    answer: "Specific in terms, describing in reasonable detail the acts restrained or required."
    explanation: "Rule 65(d) guards against vague orders so parties know exactly what conduct is prohibited or mandated."

Injunctions are equitable remedies reserved for situations where legal relief falls short. Courts weigh four familiar factors: likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm absent relief, the balance of equities, and the public interest. These factors apply to both preliminary and permanent injunctions, though a permanent injunction requires actual success on the merits rather than a likelihood.

Orders can be prohibitory—preserving the status quo by preventing action—or mandatory, compelling affirmative conduct to remedy or prevent harm. Because mandatory injunctions risk ongoing supervision and impose greater burdens, courts scrutinize them closely, often requiring a heightened showing and precise directives to avoid overreach.

Rule 65(d) obligates courts to craft injunctions with specificity, ensuring parties understand the prohibited or required acts. Overbroad orders risk reversal or contempt difficulties. Tailoring should match the proven harm, respect public interests, and avoid unnecessary burdens on nonparties. Periodic review and built-in compliance mechanisms can help maintain equitable balance.
