## Adjusting jury verdicts

**Remittitur** allows a trial judge to offer the prevailing plaintiff a choice: accept a reduced award or face a new trial on damages. Courts use it when the verdict is excessive, unsupported by the evidence, or shocks the conscience. The plaintiff’s consent cures Seventh Amendment concerns because the alternative is a new trial.

**Additur** increases a jury’s award, offering the defendant a choice between paying more or undergoing a new trial. The Supreme Court in *Dimick* held that additur violates the Seventh Amendment in federal courts because it invades the jury’s fact-finding province. Some states permit additur under their own constitutions.

## Standards of review

Trial courts evaluate whether the evidence supports the damages awarded. *Gasperini* instructs federal courts sitting in diversity to apply state law standards for excessiveness while preserving the Seventh Amendment. Appellate courts review remittitur decisions for abuse of discretion, though they may reinstate jury verdicts if the trial court overreached.

## Strategic considerations

When challenging a verdict, develop a detailed record highlighting evidentiary gaps, expert disputes, or improper arguments. Plaintiffs should assess whether accepting remittitur preserves a favorable liability finding. Defendants should consider settlement leverage created by the prospect of a new trial.
