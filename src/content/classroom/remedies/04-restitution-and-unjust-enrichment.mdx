## Conceptual foundations

Restitution prevents unjust enrichment by restoring benefits unjustly retained. Claims may sound in contract (quantum meruit for services rendered), tort (conversion damages measured by defendant’s gain), or equity (constructive trust or equitable lien).

Legal restitution awards money judgments measured by the value of benefits conferred. Equitable restitution targets specific property or its traceable product. Constructive trusts transfer title to property wrongfully held, while equitable liens secure repayment using the property as collateral.

## Measuring restitution

**Quantum meruit** recovers the reasonable value of services rendered when no enforceable contract exists. **Quantum valebant** covers goods supplied. Disgorgement measures the defendant’s profits, used for conscious wrongdoers, fiduciary breaches, or opportunistic contract breaches.

In contract breaches, restitution may exceed expectancy when the plaintiff seeks to recover the value conferred rather than lost profits, particularly when the defendant’s breach is willful.

## Defenses and priorities

Equitable restitution requires identifiable property. If funds are commingled or dissipated, claimants may be limited to legal remedies. Defenses include change of position (defendant relied on the benefit), bona fide purchaser status, or volunteer doctrine (benefits conferred officiously are not recoverable).

Restitutionary remedies often interact with bankruptcy and secured transactions. Priority battles hinge on tracing rules; the lowest intermediate balance test limits recovery when funds mix with other deposits.

## Practice tips

Choose the forum carefully: some statutes restrict equitable restitution under ERISA or other federal schemes, as highlighted in *Great-West*. Plead alternative theories to preserve both legal and equitable relief, and gather tracing evidence early through discovery or forensic accounting.
