## Jurisdictional basics

The Declaratory Judgment Act allows federal courts to declare the rights and legal relations of interested parties in a case of actual controversy. The Act does not itself confer jurisdiction; the plaintiff must establish subject-matter jurisdiction through federal-question or diversity grounds.

An actual controversy requires a substantial, immediate dispute between parties with adverse legal interests. Courts evaluate ripeness and immediacy to avoid advisory opinions. *MedImmune* adopted a flexible standard, allowing declaratory suits when a licensee continues paying royalties under protest but faces a real threat of enforcement.

## Discretionary factors

Even when jurisdiction exists, courts have discretion to decline declaratory relief. Factors include whether the judgment would settle the controversy, clarify legal relations, encourage efficient resolution, and avoid entangling federal and state courts. Parallel state proceedings, forum shopping, or procedural fencing can weigh against issuing relief.

## Relationship to coercive remedies

Declaratory judgments can precede or accompany injunctive or damages remedies. Section 2202 authorizes courts to grant supplemental relief based on the declaration. Litigants may seek declaratory relief to define obligations before breach, trigger indemnity, or resolve insurance coverage.

## Strategic use

Declaratory actions provide a proactive tool for parties threatened with liability. Consider venue, choice of law, and potential counterclaims. Evaluate whether declaratory relief will produce practical certainty or merely advisory pronouncements, and whether it may prompt settlement by clarifying stakes.
