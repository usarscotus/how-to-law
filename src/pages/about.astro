          How to Law is a volunteer collaboration designed to help roleplayers understand U.S. legal concepts. Everyone here is a peer—no one is offering professional representation, and nothing on this site is a substitute for qualified legal counsel in real life.

            Modules group lessons by theme: foundations, courtroom practice, doctrine, and advanced strategies. Each module lists its lessons in recommended order, with learning objectives, references, and practice questions. The glossary and search tools help you jump to supporting concepts whenever you need them.

            Your quiz scores and lesson checkmarks live in your browser using local storage. That means only you can see them, they do not sync across devices, and clearing your cache will reset your progress. No accounts or tracking pixels are required to learn here.

          Everything published on How to Law is for collaborative storytelling and education in the USAR setting. It is not legal advice, does not create any attorney-client relationship, and should not be relied on for real-world legal decisions. When in doubt, talk with your moderators or a licensed attorney.
